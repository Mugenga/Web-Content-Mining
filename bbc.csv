They have questioned whether unionist representatives should remain on the policing board.,Mr Byrne said he would not step down, and that such an action would undermine his predecessor. ,On Wednesday, Mr Byrne told the Nolan Show that police warned the organisers of Bobby Storey's funeral in advance that their plan would be a breach of Covid regulations. ,He also insisted that no deals were done with the organisers. ,""Nobody in the PSNI did a deal or looked the other way,"" Mr Byrne said. ,It is understood that the Police Ombudsman is giving ""careful consideration"" to issues raised in correspondence to the office, believed to be from the DUP. ,This review should not be overstated - it is something that happens, if not on a routine basis, certainly on a regular basis. ,There is a well established internal process within the PPS whereby people who are unhappy with the original decisions can have an internal review of that decision. ,This isn't a new call for evidence. ,This is simply a fresh pair of eyes and a different mind casting their eye over the same evidence and seeing whether the original decision is one that they agree with.,In my experience, it would be unusual for the original decision in these cases to be overturned. ,Mr Byrne said on Tuesday that enforcing the coronavirus regulations has been a ""consistently challenging and often uncomfortable role for my officers"", and that police did recommend prosecutions in the case.,""The decision not to prosecute does not change our view that what happened last summer when large numbers of people chose not to 'stay at home' at the height of a global pandemic was unnecessary, irresponsible and insensitive.

No, that wasn't there, we didn't find that."",Dr Sewell added that the term ""institutional racism"" is ""sometimes wrongly applied"" as a ""sort of a catch-all phrase for micro-aggressions or acts of racial abuse"".,Prof Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, said the report was not a ""genuine effort to understand racism in Britain"".,Prof Andrews said: ""It's complete nonsense. It goes in the face of all the actual existing evidence. This is not a genuine effort to understand racism in Britain. This is a PR move to pretend the problem doesn't exist."",Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chair of the ,, said: ""This report rightly identifies the varied causes of disparities and by making recommendations to address them gives the government the opportunity to design policy targeting the sources of inequality. ,""There are a number of recommendations we can play a leading role in and we welcome the recognition that additional funding would help us carry out our important work to tackle discrimination and disadvantage."",Dr Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said she felt ""deeply, massively let down"" by the report, and that the government did not have the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities.,Asked for her view on the commission's suggestion that the UK is not institutionally racist, she said: ""Tell that to the black young mother who is four times more likely to die in childbirth than her young white neighbour, tell that to the 60% of NHS doctors and nurses who died from Covid and were black and ethnic minority workers.,""You can't tell them that, because they are dead.,""Institutionally, we are still racist, and for a government-appointed commission to look into (institutional) racism, to deny its existence is deeply, deeply worrying."",She added: ""We feel that if the best this government can do is come up with a style guide on BAME terminology, or what we should do about unconscious bias training, or extend a few school hours, then I'm afraid this government doesn't carry the confidence of black and ethnic minority communities any longer, certainly not on race."",Dr Begum also claimed the report had failed to acknowledge the ""suffering"" of black and ethnic minority communities, adding: ""All this is is a whitewash and a script that has been written to 10 Downing Street."",She also questioned the suitability of Dr Sewell and head of the Number 10 policy unit Munira Mirza, who had a role in setting the commission up - both of ,. ,The 258-page report makes 24 recommendations which include: ,Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the commission had ""chosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers"" who were ""far more likely"" than white workers to be in ""low-paid, insecure jobs"".,She added they have been ""far more likely to be exposed to Covid infection and far more likely to die - because they are far more likely to be in frontline roles.,""This is institutional racism. And it traps too many black and minority ethnic workers in poverty, insecurity and low pay."",Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he felt ""disappointed"" with what he had seen of the report's findings so far, insisting there were ""structural"" issues that needed to be addressed.,Speaking on a visit to Leeds, he told reporters that whilst there was ""an acknowledgement of the problems, the issues, the challenges that face many black and minority ethnic communities"" there was also ""a reluctance to accept that that's structural"".,The report had been due to be published last year but was ,, with the commission blaming Covid restrictions and the large number of responses from the public for the delay. ,Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Alongside new devolved powers came an opportunity to shout loudly again for the capital.,For London's mayor, there was a chance to fashion a distinctive leadership role. It was not one that could be defined precisely, but over two decades it has come to mean many things.  ,Mayors have articulated responses to both crisis and celebration. ,In July 2005, Olympic triumph and terrorist tragedy became entwined in 48 hours of euphoria and mayhem. ,On 7 July, four suicide bombers with rucksacks full of explosives ,.,They killed 52 people and injured hundreds more. It remains London's worst single terrorist atrocity.,It was an examination not just of the resilience of the city itself, but of the qualities of the politician elected to speak for it. ,At the time, and again when recalled on the 10th anniversary in 2015, ,. ,Ken Livingstone was in Singapore, with London just having won its bid to host the 2012 Olympics.,His speech, hastily put together in a hotel lobby, was an evocative blend of the language of shared defiance with a sense of the unfolding practical response from the emergency services - who were working together closer than ever as part of devolved city government. ,The protocols around communication in response to acts of terror in the capital are still built primarily around the prime minister and the Metropolitan police commissioner.,But is it to the mayor that Londoners now look for reassurance?,It is now an essential part of the mayoral job specification to be able to capture tone and mood, and reflect Londoners' collective pain and pleasure. ,One notable feature over the two decades has been mayoral defiance, characterised by bullishness towards the media and opponents, and a refusal to say sorry. ,For a brief moment in 2005, the capital was even without a mayor after Ken Livingstone , after a City Hall party. ,Mr Livingstone - by now a Labour mayor after defying the party to win as an independent in his first term - was suspended from office. He was soon reinstated after a , effectively found he had the right to be offensive and didn't have to apologise.,Such was Mr Livingstone's disdain for the Evening Standard - at a time of unremittingly hostile coverage - that he couldn't find a detached, apologetic tone that might have ,. The allegations were later dismissed.,During the 2012 London Olympics, Boris Johnson took international (self?) promotion to new and dizzying heights, when he became suspended on a zip-wire in Victoria Park in east London. ,Some blamed the Conservative mayor's weight and a technical malfunction.  ,But - going against the guidance of the operators - ,, rather than folding them across his chest. ,Investigating afterwards, Tower Hamlets Council's environmental health team found nothing wrong with the equipment.,Surely this wasn't part of a plan?,Three years later in Japan, a demonstration of street rugby in Tokyo was coming to an end when Mr Johnson turned to begin his last run. ,With two UK photographers well known to him ideally positioned, ,Could anyone ever prove this was deliberate? Yet the desired effect was achieved. ,An international trip of otherwise minimal consequence was eclipsed by a viral video - with London and its mayor duly promoted across the globe.,All three mayors have been in the beam of the international spotlight on occasion. ,The current mayor has, er, trumped the lot. ,As the president of the United States touched down at Stansted airport at the beginning of his official visit in June 2019, a couple of tweets landed with him.,They labelled Sadiq Khan as a ,.,Forget zip-wires - wasn't this hitting the political jackpot? ,Mr Khan had first , for proposing a temporary travel ban for Muslims coming into the US.,It is a notable PR triumph when the most powerful politician on the planet, however unusual, knows who you are and can be bothered to attack you.,Mr Khan, previously a Labour MP, had already come to widespread attention as the first Muslim elected to lead a Western capital.,But the spat fitted with his aspirations. ,Ken Livingstone did a highly unusual deal with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.,He organised , in return for Transport for London (TfL) officials sorting out the traffic problems in Caracas. ,But while making a visit to Venezuela, Mr Livingstone only got as far as Cuba, before Mr Chavez called off their meeting because of an election campaign.,There was no meeting either with the ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro, leaving Mr Livingstone to sit reading a biography of former Vietnamese premier Ho Chi Minh in the gardens of Havana's National Hotel before flying back - to the glee of his Tory opponents.  ,All three mayors have clearly seen themselves as international players. ,Eloquent in his belief that cities drive progress, Mr Livingstone was the prime force behind the C20 - now expanded to the C40.,It's a network of major world cities pooling ideas and their combined urban spending power to drive innovation in tackling climate change.,Under Mr Johnson, though, London lost its leadership position in the group.,In 2009, at its annual international conference in South Korea - attended by Bill Clinton - Mr Johnson was sidelined and sloped off for a sightseeing trip to the demilitarised zone at the 38th parallel.,Over 20 years, the mayoralty has undoubtedly hit turbulence from time to time.,Conflicts between the last mayor and the current one - who is now of course the prime minister - raise doubts about how , planning, housing and policing in the capital. ,About 17% of the mayor's £17bn budget come from government grants.  ,Can a pugilistic approach work in a country where mayors rely heavily on central government for their resources?,It feels like the time for a reappraisal.,As for the office-holders, what unites them is showing, more than occasionally, a distinctly independent streak.",politics

It was intended to take effect in 2022 but has been held up in negotiations over wider reforms.,Officials in Brussels say the UK may not have faced legal action if it had cut the tax while those discussions are on-going and they suggest this could have been done before Brexit.,The UK's , also came into force on New Year's Day. ,It will inevitably meet one of the key aims of the Leave campaign in the referendum on EU membership - to control the number of European nationals who can settle in the UK. ,Those who were here before 31 December have until the summer to apply to stay. ,The Oxford Migration Observatory say it's impossible to spot any early effects of the system overall.,This is because of disruption to the official statistics caused by the pandemic and the longer term problem of working out if changes are due to the policy or changing circumstances in the real world, like the performance of the economy. ,The UK now has its own sanctions regime. There are some technical differences with the EU system and each side has targeted a slightly different list of people. ,In March, the UK and the EU , on a virtually identical group of Chinese officials accused of persecuting the Uyghur in Xinjiang, prompting Beijing to sanction , in return.,The foreign secretary said that there might not be that much difference between the UK and the EU in future, writing to the House of Lords: ""International co-operation will remain at the heart of UK sanctions policy."",In February, the United States agreed to temporarily cut the taxes which had been slapped on , in a long-running dispute about the manufacture of planes.,The prime minister celebrated, saying: ""It shows what the UK can do as an independent trading nation."" ,The very next day the EU received the same treatment, with the US cutting tariffs on tractors, wine and cheese. ,Sources close to the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss say that Brexit meant she could drop the UK's tariffs on the US, to encourage the Biden administration to come to the negotiating table.,They said it is surely no coincidence the 16-year dispute ended just weeks after the UK took control of its trade policy. ,""We want to reward the work farmers do to manage every metre of hedgerows on their holdings sustainably,"" Environment Secretary George Eustice told the Oxford Farming Conference in February.,He said farmers previously could not apply for money to help protect hedgerows from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy because they were dubbed ""ineligible features"".,This would change with the UK's post-Brexit Sustainable Farming Incentive, the government claims. ,The National Farmers Union say that's not strictly accurate because some hedgerows were recognised previously, and there was also a separate British grant scheme for them. ,Hence the environment secretary's careful reference to ""every metre"" in the new scheme, which won't be fully in place until 2028. ,The UK is still very early in its post-Brexit journey. And - as usual - nothing in this debate is quite as simple as it first appears.,And while looking at these ""quick-wins"" is an interesting intellectual exercise, it's a difficult one because we can't drop into a parallel universe where the UK is still in the EU to see what might be different.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56518305,Can Priti Patel's asylum plan work?,"Back in 2003, Tony Blair - the then Labour Prime Minister - was under such sustained pressure over asylum seekers entering the country that he made a PR-savvy pledge to halve the number entering Britain before the year was out. , - but that year also poisoned the public mood against the government. ,No matter what the government did or said, many people concluded ministers had no control of immigration. ,All these years on, Home Secretary Priti Patel is telling us that the system is still broken because the numbers are unsustainable. ,In the context of 20 years of immigration crises, the total number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK is actually very low. ,Last year, almost 30,000 people sought asylum here - and more than 8,000 of them crossed the English Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. ,That's a third of the all-time record set in 2002 when the issue gripped the nation. And the UK's figures are nowhere near Germany's, which admitted more than one million in just a year during the Syria crisis. ,To put all of this into context, earlier this week , into Kent on one day. To reach the levels seen in the UK at the start of the century, dinghies would have to bring 300 a day, every day, for a year.,While the numbers of applicants have indeed recently begun to rise again, so has the backlog of unresolved cases. ,In 2010, almost 12,000 asylum seekers were waiting to hear if they could stay in the UK. Just before the pandemic hit, that number had reached almost 44,000.  ,Cases are taking longer to resolve and that, in turn, makes the system more expensive, as the Home Office has to house and feed people who are not allowed to work while they wait for a decision on their futures. ,And so these statistics lead critics to say that the real problem remains fundamental mismanagement of asylum over decades. ,Let's take the core proposal to treat some asylum seekers differently to break the power of criminal gangs. ,Anyone coming via proposed new official routes, such as the recent Syrian resettlement scheme taking people from camps, would be fast-tracked into a new and permanent life in the UK. ,Just putting to one side the fact that we don't know what these officials routes are, anyone who doesn't use them may be relying on people smugglers. ,The UK will restrict that group of people's rights to live a normal life and try to send them back to other safe countries they have passed through along the way. ,Those it can't eject will never get permanent residence and will face repeated attempts to remove them in the years that follow. ,The aim is to undercut the awful criminal economy of smugglers who profit from misery as they pack people onto boats.  ,Many legal experts predict the plan would breach the international law that the UK helped devise - that states we should treat all asylum seekers equally and fairly.,But officials think that's not quite the point and there is room to create sanctions to break the link with criminal gangs.,, countries can't penalise refugees for illegally entering a nation, providing they come ""directly"" to its shores, or have a good explanation for how they have turned up via some more complicated route. ,But while an asylum seeker is not obliged to seek sanctuary in the first safe country they reach, nor do they have an unfettered right to shop around. ,The Home Office seems confident that provides the legal room for it to take steps against asylum seekers who have paid smugglers, in the hope that it will deter others from doing the same.  ,Just supposing all of this becomes law, there is an elephant trumpeting away in the Home Office's shiny glass atrium: where is the UK actually going to send anyone whom it wants to get rid of?,The number of people being removed from the UK - be they failed asylum seekers or, separately, foreign national criminals, has been falling over a decade. ,And the UK has not been able to send a single failed asylum seeker to its immediate neighbours since the end of Brexit, when it left the EU-wide system governing such transfers. ,There is no new legal agreement in place - and there is no way that the UK can force France, Italy, Greece or wherever else to receive people without permission. ,The Home Office hopes to strike new deals - but until it does so there is the possibility, say some experts, that the plans will just make matters worse. ,If attempts to discourage people from using smugglers fail, people will still be turning up, but now without the right to settle permanently and put down roots. ,Denied benefits or the right to work under the planned restrictions, they could end up destitute. ,And if they can't be sent anywhere else, they may remain on the streets, in limbo. ,Just like Tony Blair's government, the challenge for this Home Secretary is to have enough time to prove that the system she says is broken is on its way to being mended.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56515028,Coronavirus: Is it time for a new Beveridge report?,"Almost 80 years since Sir William Beveridge published his plans for a new system of ""cradle to grave"" social security, politicians on the left and right are trying to claim the spirit of the Beveridge era as they sketch out plans for life after the pandemic. ,At his party conference last year, Boris Johnson described how, in the depths of World War Two, the National Government had set out a vision for a New Jerusalem. ,And in a speech last month, Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer said Covid-19 had been a call to arms that now required a Beveridge-scale response from government. ,But is this simply political hyperbole or are we at a similar turning point? ,The pandemic has certainly been a shared upheaval and trauma unlike anything Britain has experienced since the war. ,Sir William Beveridge's 1942 report did not land without warning.,It had been commissioned by a government made up of Conservative and Labour ministers who were already thinking about reconstruction even as the fighting continued. ,The experience of war had amplified a debate about the condition of the country - its poverty, housing and health. ,But the 300-page report that Sir William, a Liberal retired civil servant, delivered that December was an immediate sensation. ,The dryly titled , report was densely technical but charged with moral purpose. Beveridge described slaying the ""five giants on the road to reconstruction"": Want, disease, idleness, ignorance and squalor. ,Implemented after the war by Labour, the report's recommendations laid the foundation of the modern welfare state and the NHS was also born. It was a short period of radical social reform without precedent. ,Does this feel a similar moment? A war and a pandemic are very different of course. And the UK today is a country Sir William Beveridge wouldn't recognise. ,Wealthier, more diverse and wired into a mobile, global economy. Many of the jobs people do are utterly different compared to the 1940s. ,But Beveridge would recognise the broad debates about poverty, insecure employment, the nation's health and inequality that have been magnified by Covid. ,A decade ago, the epidemiologist Professor Sir Michael Marmot wrote ,. He's recently produced another Beveridge-esque study called Build Back Fairer. ,He says of his review: ""Life expectancy had stopped improving. Inequalities in health were increasing and life expectancy for the poorest people outside London was going down. It means we were in terrible shape."" ,The pandemic has cruelly exposed the underlying vulnerabilities of UK's health. It has shone a harsh light on the state of the social care sector too.,Perhaps that is the issue a modern-day Beveridge might choose to tackle first - whoever that may be. ,Unlike the NHS, social care is not free at the point of use. ,The delivery of health and social care is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each nation has developed their care systems in different ways. ,England awaits reform.,All recent governments have known an aging population requires complex care within a system that is properly and sustainably funded. But despite years of reports, a Royal Commission and a forest full of policy papers, the nettle has never been grasped. ,This government has promised proposals by the end of this year.,Indeed, at a Liaison Committee session on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said there will be proposals brought forward in the coming year.,""It is going to be difficult. There is no solution to social care which avoids real decision about who pays for what and how much we pay,"" says Rachel Wolf, who co-authored the Tories' 2019 manifesto. ,""My assumption is they will not only bring forward some kind of package around funding but also about how it's delivered. ,""Do we want to make it easier for there to be in-home social care for example? What is that we want the workforce to look like and how are we going to train and support them? Often with social care we get so caught up in the funding question we don't actually discuss any of the others,"" she told me.,The costs of social care can be catastrophic for people. Care is means-tested and unlike the NHS, the principle of pooled risk does not apply. ,But could the aftermath of the pandemic be the moment a cross-party consensus on the future of social care might be found? ,Recent history is not encouraging. ,Less politically controversial, but perhaps just as hard to tackle, are the inequalities in health exposed by coronavirus.  ,""Obesity and deprivation and poverty and the type of job you lead have all contributed to the increased death rate in this country from Covid-19,"" according to Dame Sally Davies, the former Chief Medical Officer for England.,She believes tackling obesity is an urgent priority (""we are the fatties of Europe,"" she says) and has called for an extension of the sugar levy and for private companies to contribute to a public health investment fund.,""I think post-Covid-19, the government has the mandate to do something different along the Beveridge lines. Beveridge got us to invest in a national illness service. We needed that then and still need it. But alongside that we need to invest in prevention."",The political historian Peter Hennessey believes the ""never again"" impulse that sprung from the war is evident now and could be harnessed to build consensus around five new priorities.,He has suggested: housing, technical education, tackling climate change, preparing the UK for the impact of artificial intelligence and, of course, reform of social care. Others will have their own ideas about what the UK might be galvanized to tackle.,Or perhaps, as the jabs rollout, the pubs reopen and families reunite, Britain will muddle its way back to business as usual with a sigh of relief.,Before the pandemic hit the post-Brexit (media) narrative was about a fractured country of conflicting values, outlooks and views. Is there really the popular kindling for a new consensus around radical social reform?,Compared with the figures who drove through the Beverage agenda are today's politicians too small to try and grapple modern giants?,Citing Sir William Beveridge and the era's reforming zeal is the easy part. Carrying the country into action may prove much harder. ",politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56592411,UK exporters consider 'worst case scenario' plans,"An initial 41% plunge in goods going to the EU in January was described by the government as ""teething problems"" which it said were hard to separate out from the impact of COVID-related disruption.,The government insists that ""overall freight volumes between the UK and the EU"" have been back to their normal levels since the start of February, and that there is no general disruption at UK ports.,However, haulage groups insist recent figures on freight volume tally the number of vehicles and ferry movements, rather than the value of the actual goods traded between the EU and UK and many more lorries than before are returning to the EU empty. An admittedly small sample of members of the Federation of Small Business found that one in four exporters had paused sales to the EU and 11% were considering abandoning exports to the bloc completely. ,Scott Clarke is a director at Rex London, a specialist gift company selling goods all over Europe. He described January as ""chaotic"". There were delays and confusion at customs, additional freight costs, and extra charges for his EU customers in the form of duties and taxes.  Many of his shipments weren't getting through at all and were returned to his warehouse in west London.,""We had hundreds of boxes we tried to send in January, and they all came back,"" says Scott.,""There was probably a three or four week period at the beginning of the year where we couldn't supply our customers at all, which is a big deal for us because over half of our business is with Europe."",He acknowledges that things have got better, but many of the difficulties they have faced are here to stay.,""It has calmed down a lot. We can supply our customers in Europe now. But we're three months in, and this doesn't seem sustainable in the longer term,"" he adds. ,""There's been a lot of talk about teething issues. There were teething issues, but they were just part of the underlying problems that haven't gone away."",What's the solution? For Scott, it's to establish a warehouse in Belgium so he can better serve his customers in Europe, without customs delays and extra costs. It's something they previously saw as a ""worst case scenario"" option, and he says there'll be negative consequences for the UK. ,""Splitting off part of our business and sending it to Belgium probably means that further growth is going to be happening there. Instead of taking on new staff here, we'll employ them there. Instead of making more profit and paying more tax here, we'll pay it there. Basically, everyone is losing out here,"" he says.,He's not the only one looking at establishing a base in the EU. The BBC has spoken to a number of investment agencies around Europe - including in Germany, Belgium, Austria and France. All of them say they've seen a big increase in the number of UK businesses expressing an interest in moving some of their operations across the channel. The Netherlands is emerging as a favourite destination. ,Michiel Bakhuizen is from the Netherlands Foreign investment Agency. They have been in talks with over 600 UK businesses since the Brexit referendum, and the monthly numbers have increased since the start of this year.,""In January, 40 companies made enquiries, in February it doubled to 80 companies, and up until the middle of March it was 40 again, so interest is really growing. The numbers have more than doubled on the average month in 2020,"" says Michiel.,""Interest has grown since January, because of the real difficulties Brexit is causing some companies in the UK. They're talking about administrative hurdles, supply chain related problems, licensing issues, so those problems are real and that's why those companies are showing interest in the Netherlands and other countries."",Michiel is keen to point out there are downsides for the Netherlands too.,""The Netherlands is not 'winning' this. If you look at Brexit from a macro perspective, the Netherlands just lost its second biggest trading partner, moving outside the European Union and the single market,"" he says. ,""Obviously attracting foreign business towards the Netherlands is growing because UK businesses need a future in the European market, and the Netherlands is there to help them to secure that, but in the end Brexit is not good news for the Netherlands."",For other exporters to the EU, shifting some of the business closer to their customers just isn't an option. ,Sarah Braithwaite's company, Forage Plus, specialises in nutritional products for horses, which have proved to be very popular with European customers in recent years. They're based in North Wales, but up until January, they were able to ship their goods to 20 European countries within a matter of days. Not anymore. One package she sent to Sweden in January still hasn't arrived, with customs officers there requesting additional documentation to clear it, from manufacturing flow charts to photos of individual products. But there are other issues too. ,""It's been frustrating, demoralising, upsetting. For a while we just thought it was a hold-up at customs, just the sheer volume of shipments and they couldn't cope. And then we realised we weren't going to be able to get our parcels into Europe without our customers paying quite big import duties,"" she says.,Rather than shipping to other businesses in Europe, Sarah sends her goods directly to customers, who have been faced with unexpected duties and taxes, as high as 40% of the original price, depending on which EU country it goes to. Together with customs delays, it's meant that orders have dried up, and she's had to refund thousands of pounds.,""For us, as a company shipping into Europe, a typical month would be around 160, 170, 180 orders into 18 to 20 different countries. Today, when I asked my staff how many we have into Europe, there are none. How many orders have we had this month? Two or three,"" she says.,""If a customer orders from Europe today, we can't actually get it to them. In some instances we can't get it to them at all, and in others, they're charged such a large amount of import duty that they're just not going to do that. We're going to lost that custom."",Sarah hasn't given up entirely and is trying to find ways to keep supplying her customers. A Dutch warehouse isn't on the cards though.,""It's unrealistic to say, set up some kind of European warehouse when you haven't got the finances or the manpower. We would have to employ new people. How are we going to employ new people when we've just lost £300,000 worth of business? It's just not realistic, it really isn't."",The government has set up a £20m Brexit Support Fund for small and medium-sized businesses and is also providing export helplines, and webinars with a network of 300 international trade experts.,This assistance has been welcomed and the Federation of Small Businesses has called for an increase in the size of the support fund.  ,But the provision of this support is perhaps a tacit acknowledgement on the part of the government that something that was once easy and cheap is now difficult and expensive. Given that the EU accounts for nearly half of all UK exports, that is a reality that cannot be good for the UK economy. ,Much-vaunted trade deals with countries including the US, Australia, New Zealand and others have not yet arrived and the government's own analysis said deals with all of them would add less than 1% to UK GDP in 15 years' time and fail to offset the hit to trade with the EU. ,The tariff-free trade with the EU that the Brexit deal secured is welcomed by business but tariffs are only a small part of the picture. What many businesses are discovering is that exporting requires time, investment and expertise. For decades, sending goods to Berlin was as easy as sending goods to Birmingham - as a member of a single market without trade borders or barriers, it wasn't really exporting at all. ,Michael Gove said he hoped the exporting expertise firms are acquiring (reluctantly in many cases) will make them ""match fit"" to grasp new opportunities beyond the EU. ,But back in west London, Scott says the last three months have highlighted the challenges businesses face in sending their goods anywhere around the world.,""One of the great irritations for me is the idea that we're going to suddenly be free to export more around the world. It's just not true. Exporting is really difficult. I think if anything, people will now know how difficult it is.""",politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-56583168,Scottish election 2021: Five things we learned from the first debate,"The Scottish Parliament term ended in a blaze of bad temper, with votes of no confidence and personal attacks flying thick and fast.,So this debate was a chance to see if the temperature would come down as parties hit the campaign trail - or escalate still further.,The leaders all called each other by their first names throughout, and with the audience dialling in from home sought not to shout over each other in the hush of a largely deserted studio - at least to start with.,But ultimately there are deep divisions between these politicians. And they showed.,It is still early days in the election campaign, but already the shapes of the platforms parties are building are becoming clear.,SNP leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon leaned on her pandemic leadership and the promise of a fresh choice on Scotland's future for the electorate - with a heavy caveat that any vote would come ,the health crisis has passed.,As in her campaign conference speech on Monday, Ms Sturgeon chose to single out her dream opponent in this debate - the prime minister.,On independence, her pitch is straightforward - who would you rather have in charge, me or Boris Johnson?,But it was another politician, not actually in the room, who was cited by Ms Sturgeon's opponents - Alex Salmond and his new Alba Party.,His intervention complicates the independence issue for Ms Sturgeon, in that he and his party present a different vision of her core policy and even different ways of achieving it - opening up all kinds of detailed, difficult questions that the SNP leader would rather keep for another day and campaign.,But ultimately the former first minister was not the ghost at the feast in this event - the leaders present managed to drag the debate back to independence time and again all on their own. ,Somehow, even what looked set to be a heart-warming segment at the end where all the leaders agreed to call out abusive language in political discourse ended with a row about the constitution.,Conservative leader Douglas Ross sought to galvanise his base by going back to the well of ""no referendum"" repeatedly. He mainly sought out clashes with Ms Sturgeon, given his party's goal is to deprive her party of a majority and provide ""strong opposition"" at Holyrood.,He may have actually overdone it somewhat when he said he wouldn't even work with the SNP to tackle climate change, such are their constitutional disagreements.,And independence was also his weapon of choice when attacking Anas Sarwar, seeking to tempt any hardcore unionists in the Labour ranks into backing his party instead.,Mr Sarwar, recently elected the leader of a party which has lost its position atop Scottish politics along with much of its traditional support to the SNP over recent years, has a more difficult tightrope to walk.,The primacy of the constitutional debate has left Labour looking rather shut out in campaigns since the 2014 referendum, with the SNP corralling pro-independence voters and the Conservatives cloaking themselves in the Union flag.,But the pandemic - along with Mr Sarwar's extremely-new-broom leadership - has added a fresh edge to their cry of ""wouldn't you rather talk about something else?"",Thus he sought to appear the reasonable alternative to both parties at every turn. If Labour has bled votes to both ends of the constitutional spectrum in the past, Mr Sarwar hopes to win them back from both ends now too.,Green co-leader Lorna Slater also had a tricky balancing act to perform, in her first appearance in a TV debate.,With the Alba Party providing extra competition for pro-independence votes, the Greens need to underline their credentials on that front - and she did so with another attack on the Westminster government.,However, they also need to differentiate themselves from the SNP, to give that party's supporters a reason to not just back them on both ballot papers. In the year the COP26 climate summit comes to Glasgow, the environment is as solid an electoral hook as anyone could wish for, and it's home turf for the Greens.,Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie was one of the more experienced campaigners on the stage, and he harked back to previous campaigns by stressing that he didn't want to repeat them.,The Lib Dems have long traded off their pro-European image, and Mr Rennie used that to prop up his other constitutional argument by saying a new independence vote would be a re-run of Brexit.,In trademark Rennie style he also provided one of the few laughs of the evening when he was caught on camera waving back at audience members who were saying goodbye at the end of the programme.,This was an early-election contest, with parties happy for a chance to set the tone for the weeks ahead - but mostly seeking to avoid any serious gaffes.,In fact it's so early in the campaign that nobody has published a manifesto yet.,None of the leaders opted to use the debate to launch a shiny new policy, so ultimately they either had to stick to predictable, well-trodden ground, or drop some hints.,Nicola Sturgeon let slip that there might be something to come in the SNP manifesto about the universal basic income, an idea the party has backed trials of in the past.,But somehow the biggest row about a specific manifesto promise was one dating back to 2007 - the SNP's pledge to scrap the council tax, which sparked yet another confrontation between Mr Ross and Ms Sturgeon.,In the weeks ahead, more policy pledges and details should be forthcoming - providing plenty of fodder for the debates to come.",business

This number is then multiplied by 100,000.,Looking at the total number of cases by health board, the highest number has been in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, reflecting the fact it is the most populous part of Scotland.,The coronavirus outbreak has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals during both the first and second waves of the pandemic.,At the peak of the outbreak in the spring there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, including over 200 in intensive care wards.,Numbers reduced over the summer, but started to rise steadily again in September. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital passed the spring peak of 1,520.,Only patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.,They are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.,However, the Scottish government now publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days.,The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the percentage of positive test results is a key measure ,.,The organisation recommended in May that a country's positivity rate should be below 5% for at least two weeks before governments considered relaxing lockdown restrictions.,Other measures include a decline in Covid-related deaths and hospital admissions.,The Scottish government ,.,This chart shows the positivity rate in Scotland since 18 August.,The Scottish government ,.,Previously, the government calculated it by dividing the number of positive cases with the number of newly-tested individuals each day.,However, it now calculates the rate using the number of positive tests reported each day.,The Scottish government said it changed the method to bring it into line with the WHO's criteria, and because the previous measure was ""likely to over-estimate the positivity rate"" as more people were repeatedly tested.,The R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.,If the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.,The Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland ,.",business

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56344609,How bees and drones team up to find landmines,"Thanks to the fact that they can pick up the scent of explosives with their antennae, researchers in countries such as Croatia have spent years perfecting how to use bees as landmine locators.,But there's a problem. As the insects whizz merrily about a mine-contaminated area, it's extremely difficult for humans to keep track of where they go, not least because chasing bees across a minefield is not a great idea.,That's where the drones come in. A team from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia have come up with a way of using drones to monitor the bees while they work. The unmanned aerial vehicles fly around, capturing footage of the insects, which is later analysed by computers to reveal where landmines may be hidden in the ground.,Landmines buried during wars that happened decades ago continue to present a deadly threat in many parts of the world. Many thousands were planted during the Balkans war of the 1990s and many persist today., in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ,. Clearing the devices is seen as a long-term, arduous project with no easy solutions. But technological innovations could still make a difference.,""We wanted to try to exclude humans from potential danger… and try to use drones,"" says Vladimir Risojević from the University of Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina.,Previously, another team of fellow researchers , in landmine detection. They achieved this by getting the bees to associate the smell of TNT with food - a sugar solution.,In the field, the trained bees tend to cluster near to places where mines are buried, in the hope of finding food.,Such efforts have been active for many years but Prof Risojević says he and his team realised that computers could help by automatically analysing footage of the mine-seeking bees, in order to plot their activity and more easily locate the mines.,Even this proved tricky.,""It's very difficult for human observers to find these flying bees in this video footage let alone computer vision systems,"" he says.,""There were moments when I thought that we are outright crazy for trying to do that but I am pleasantly surprised with the results that we obtained."",The team began with drone-captured footage of an outdoor area, onto which they superimposed ""synthetic bees"" - fuzzy grey blobs zooming about the scene. ,When they managed to get the synthetic bees to look indistinguishable from footage of real bees, the team turned to a machine-learning algorithm, and trained it to accurately detect and follow the blobs on screen.,In tests ,, the algorithm proved more than 80% accurate at tracking these digital bees. ,The researchers then took to a minefield, a safe one with real but defused mines buried in undisclosed locations at the Croatia Mine Action Center, to see how the system performed under authentic conditions.,Details of the test results are yet to be published in an academic paper but Prof Risojević says there was a strong correlation between where the bees clustered and the locations of known mines at the test site. ,At the moment, the system works by using drones programmed to fly along a predetermined route, criss-crossing the minefield while capturing footage of the bees as they buzz around. Analysis of the footage later reveals where the bees clustered. ,It may be a few years before this approach is used in a place blighted with dangerous, active mines, says Prof Risojević. However, he thinks it could complement other demining techniques. Among the technological tools already used for demining are , with built-in ground-penetrating radar.,Even with the help of technology like that, it's hard for demining teams to know for sure that they have removed every single mine from a contaminated area. The bees and drones could check afterwards, for example, to confirm that none have been missed.,""Good technological innovation that can help to… delineate the boundaries and confirm a hazard area are really helpful,"" says Matthew Breay Bolton at Pace University in New York, author of Political Minefields: The Struggle against Automated Killing.,However, he adds that there are no quick fixes to the minefield problem. Often, political wrangling and lack of resources mean clearance projects can stall, no matter what technologies are available to help. Plus, in countries such as Yemen, ,.,Prof Risojević is hopeful that, despite the hurdles, his team's system will one day help to decontaminate minefields in countries such as Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina. ,And there may be other applications too.,In recent years, computer vision researchers have developed experimental systems able to ,. Prof Risojević and his team suggest that such tools could one day monitor pollinators. These insects, including bees, are crucial to the health of crops and ecosystems but their numbers have been declining lately, largely due to pollution caused by human activities. ,Insects and machines working together - a fun idea, and potentially good for the planet.",business

While 35% of such organisations say they have seen a decrease in the number of people volunteering over the past year, 20% saw a rise, and 45% no change, , (National Council for Voluntary Organisations).,This has come at the same time as the NCVO said there was more demand on charities' services, and several other studies say ,So how can charities both engage more volunteers, and raise more funds to meet the continuing increase in need for their services? A number of tech firms believe they can help.,Deedmob, an Amsterdam-based small firm, says the way to get more young adults volunteering is simply to make it easier for them to do so.,Founded in 2016 by three student friends, its website and app matches people's skills and interests with volunteering tasks and causes, and allows them to volunteer for short periods of time rather than have to make long-term commitments.,""A lot of people want to do some volunteering next to their job, or while they study, but before they couldn't find the right opportunities at the right time,"" says Deedmob co-founder and chief executive Boudewijn Wijnands.,Ms Smissaert has done voluntary work for the past seven years, everything from helping people find jobs, to assisting newly settled refugees, and the more recent delivering food shopping. She has signed up to Deedmob, and says it has been very useful.,""I can imagine that if it's so easy to engage with, it's also easy to disengage from,"" she says, ""but it's so amazing that people are giving their time to the website, so it's still a win."",Regarding volunteering in general, Ms Smissaert adds: ""We have to create our own special value in the things we do on a daily basis."",In addition to its main platform, Deedmob created a special website last year called Coronahelpers.nl that focused specifically on volunteering work related to the pandemic and lockdowns.,It mobilised volunteers to help 25,000 people in its first three weeks, and was praised by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.,The firm allows smaller charities to use Deedmob for free, either by listing on it, or using its technology on their own websites. It makes money by charging corporate clients such as airline KLM and clothing brand H&M, which use Deedmob's software to help their employees sign up for voluntary work.,In the south-west of England, Anglican priest Rev Simon Bale uses a Deedmob-powered website called Spark A Change to mobilise and manage volunteers from his congregation in Bridgewater, Somerset.,He organises grocery and prescription deliveries, dog walking, and social chats for those in need via the website, which is run by local charity Spark Somerset. ,""A greater sense of trust in the community has come out of the volunteering,"" says Rev Bale.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56495443,I have learned how to survive with a bow and arrow',"It's past midnight deep in a Florida wetland, and I'm riding in a ridiculously beefed-up Jeep with a loaded rifle and a $12,000 (£8,700) thermal night-vision scope in my lap.,The muddy water is so deep that it occasionally spills over into the windowless vehicle, as I scan around my seat nervously for alligators. Simultaneously, I'm trying to follow a conversation between two scraggly men speaking a dialect of English that I can barely understand.,The story of how someone like me, who only a year ago would've been far more likely to be in a yoga class in Brooklyn, is hunting for wild hogs with a bunch of self-identifying hillbillies is a complicated one. Yet strangely enough, I'm far from alone.,Like some , I bought a firearm for the first time. I walked into a gun store, which was also an entirely new thing for me to do, and purchased a bolt-action Winchester 30.06 hunting rifle.,The decision was driven as much by fears over social unrest as concern that the food supply chain might break down due to the pandemic.,While I would in no way call myself a ""prepper"" or doomsday cultist, the sight of violent clashes on the streets last summer, and empty shelves at grocery stores, was enough to inspire me to buy a gun for safety, and learn how to use it to procure food in the wild.,After panic buying caused severe ammunition shortages across the country, I then went a step further, learning to track and hunt game with a bow and arrow, and process meat in the field. ,Over the past few months, I've been set upon by a snarling coyote that only stopped once I pointed a gun at its face from 10ft (three metres) away, and forged an unlikely friendship with a hunting and survival mentor from Pennsylvania. He's been shot in the back by poachers, and attacked by bears.,Not long ago, if someone told me they were learning to survive in the woods with a bow and arrow in case of social collapse in the US, I would've thought they were unhinged. But further statistics suggest an increasing number of people are taking those concerns seriously. ,Last year, the state of Michigan reported , Many of those people came from outside traditional hunting demographics - a shift that's been reflected throughout the US. ,Dave Marks is one of them. A doctor in the uber-liberal college town of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, he walked into a gun store at the start of the pandemic and bought one of the last shotguns on the shelf.,Within a few months, he was hunting - something that didn't sit very well with his wife, an ""anti-gun, anti-hunting vegan"", or their vegetarian children.  ""I was raised by New York Jews,"" says Mr Marks. ""No one hunted in my family. No one had guns. Hunting always seemed ethically questionable to me, something that mostly rednecks do."",Despite his wife's dismay, he taught himself to hunt with guns and crossbows, learned how to field dress deer, and even purchased hunting land. While he says the possibility of the food supply chain breaking down was part of the consideration, he's more interested in ethical meat harvesting and wildlife conservation.,A self-described ""moderate liberal,"" he also found himself making peace with the conservatism of rural America at a time when those two sides of the US were seemingly not on speaking terms with one another. ""It makes you appreciate the commonalities, the things that you can relate to with people from different backgrounds and political views,"" he says.,The hope within the hunting community is that the new enthusiasts like Mr Marks will help reinvigorate a pastime that had been in sharp decline.,In 2016 there were 11.5 million hunters in the US, ,This was down from 13.7 million in 2011, and the more than 17 million back in the 1980s.,Reasons for the fall range from the increased popularity of vegetarian or vegan diets, to public shaming of hunters, and fewer young people taking up the hobby.,These declines in hunting numbers were welcome news to some animal rights advocates, and we have to respect their viewpoint.,People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), the world's largest animal rights organization, says that hunting is an ""unnecessary, violent form of 'entertainment' [that] rips animal families apart"". Anyone interested ,However, state wildlife agencies get about 60% of their budget from the sale of hunting licenses, and taxes on guns and ammunition.,They also rely heavily on hunters to control animal populations that have made extraordinary comebacks since managed wildlife programs began in the early 20th century. In 1930, for example, there were only 300,000 white tail deer left in the US. Today, ,There are also increasing efforts to make the US hunting community less white, and less male. Website Outdoor Life estimated in 2019 ,Opportunity Outdoors is a volunteer organization based in North Carolina whose mission is to bring new people into hunting by making it more inclusive and accessible.,Founded in 2019 by young hunters Andy Tomaszewski and Evan Trebilcock, their intention was to create a scalable mentorship program that could be rolled out nationally over the next few years. The group promotes ethical hunting combined with conservation and outdoor survival skills such as wild foraging. ,Their outreach coordinator, 23-year-old Safiyyah Motaib, grew up in Queens, New York. She's also a practicing Muslim of Moroccan descent who performs her daily prayers while out in the field. And she hunts according to Islam's Halal slaughter rules, whispering prayers before firing upon an animal.,""As a kid growing up in New York, I fantasized about the outdoors,"" says Ms Motaib, who is a research biochemist. ""I've always wanted to buy a hunting rifle. Covid pushed me to do that sooner, and it gave me the time to go out and start hunting.,""As far as the food supply system breaking down, I definitely think it's possible in a bigger crisis.

Students from across the US and around the world hike out into the desert for up to 28 days, carrying next to nothing, making their own fires, catching their own food, and drinking rainwater.   ,Mr Thomas believes the surge in interest since Covid-19 is two-fold.

In his case, Carl says freecodecamp.org was particularly helpful.,Attending a boot camp is another popular option for career changers. Many of these have sprung up in recent years, offering intensive courses designed to equip participants with the skills needed to get that crucial first job.,Brenden Thornton chose this route, enrolling on a course offered by boot camp Flatiron School, whilst shifting careers away from being an National Basketball Association (NBA) cameraman.,""One big advantage of going to a boot camp is having a set curriculum planned out for you. I didn't have to do any guesswork when it came to deciding what technologies to learn and how I was going to teach them to myself,"" he explains.,The support that comes with attending such boot camps was also key in his decision.,""They really take the time to build a solid support team around you, not only through job opportunities, but also through career coaches who help you navigate the job search process."",One drawback of boot camps is that they can demand a lot of time and, for many, be prohibitively expensive. Many courses exceed $10,000.,A partial scholarship helped ease some of the financial burden for Brenden, but he still had a gruelling schedule.,During the boot camp his Monday to Friday routine involved getting up at 05:00 to drive for Uber and Lyft until 09:00.

""We think this is a very unfair situation,"" he told the BBC at a press conference.,In response, the company has stockpiled chips, invested in research and development, and diversified its supplies. ,It has also reportedly been developing its own chip production within China. Building domestic capacity for the most-advanced chips is currently a high priority for China. ,There is currently a worldwide shortage of chips, and Mr Hu called for a ""rethinking"" and a ""review"" of the globalised semi-conductor supply chain.,US authorities have argued that using Huawei's 5G equipment opens up countries to the possibilities of data being accessed by the Chinese state, or becoming vulnerable to being switched off.,Huawei has defended its independence from the Chinese state by trying to explain its unusual model of ownership. ,Jiang Xisheng, chief secretary of the board at Huawei, told the BBC that its employee-shareholders ""will not allow external interference into the company's operations"".,The company gave the BBC a remote video tour of the vault where more than 30 large cabinets contain records of the employees who own shares, listing when each individual bought them and for how much. ,Critics have said the system is opaque, and is more of a profit-sharing scheme than a mechanism of real control.,Mr Jiang compared the model to the partnership model of UK department store John Lewis, arguing it means the interests of employees are closely bound up with those of the company and it shares in its success.,Technically there are two owners of Huawei's holding company - its founder Ren Zhengfei, who owns 0.9%, and a trade union body which owns the rest.,The company says the union is the platform for the more than 121,000 employees who own shares. These are not like normal shares, however. Non-Chinese staff are not allowed to own them and the shares cannot be publicly traded or kept when someone leaves.,Holding a share offers a chance to vote for the representative commission which is technically the highest authority in the company. Candidates come from within different sectors of the company, and staff can watch a recorded presentation before voting. ,The process, Mr Jiang says, is competitive, although not as much as the US general election, he said when asked to compare it. ,This commission selects the board of directors which report to it every year. Its reports have always been approved.,Mr Ren retains a veto over key issues, including candidates for the board of directors and a supervisory board. The model for this, Mr Jiang explains, is partly that of the British constitutional monarch. He says the veto is designed to be a ""deterrent and constraint"" rather than to be regularly exercised.,Mr Jiang joined the company in 1989, two years after it was founded, when it consisted of only about 40 staff.,He says the employee-ownership model came about to bring in capital as well as to attract and retain staff, and has allowed Huawei to focus on long-term research and development.,To try to emphasise the company's openness, Mr Jiang picked up his phone during the interview to explain that all employees have an app on which they can post comments and ideas. He says that before our interview, he had seen one post that criticised him. ,Half of the 70 replies had backed the criticism and half had defended him, he said.,External critics, especially in the US, have argued that the representation committee is no more than a rubber-stamp and real power lies elsewhere, leaving the way open for hidden direction from the state. ,That is an idea Mr Jiang seeks to dispel. ,""For sure, we can say no to the state,"" he told the BBC. ""Even if some individual government officials wanted to intervene in our company's operations we have the right to say no to that."" ",business
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56582568,Retailers call for 'Shop Out to Help Out' scheme when stores reopen,"They want the chancellor to offer a ""Shop Out to Help Out"" scheme to get consumers spending again when non-essential shops reopen on 12 April.,It would cover 50% of a shopper's costs, up to £10, on Monday to Wednesdays for a month. ,And it would only apply at physical stores with fewer than 10 staff. ,The ""Save The Street"" campaign says independent retailers won't survive without it. The Treasury did not comment on whether it would pursue the idea, but said it had protected ""millions"" of retail jobs during the pandemic.,The proposed scheme - which would work like the Eat Out to Help Out restaurant discounts last year - is backed by the likes of beauty entrepreneur Charlotte Tilbury, fashion designer Henry Holland and retail consultant Mary Portas. ,""We would be kidding ourselves to think that everything will be fine for independent retailers once they reopen on 12 April,"" says Ross Bailey, the entrepreneur leading the campaign.,""Now it is the government's responsibility to support these businesses and ensure they are given a fighting chance to bounce back - the government needs to show that all businesses matter, not just big businesses."",The British Retail Consortium estimates that non-essential retail stores lost around £22bn in sales in 2020 due to lockdown measures, as footfall declined by 40%.,Independent shops - many of which lack a strong online presence - were hit particularly hard as they faced prolonged closures and restrictions. ,Yet this hasn't stopped people from trying to start businesses. Latest data from Cornerstone Tax, which gives advice on property stamp duty, shows 13% of consumers have started, or intend to start, their own business in 2021.,The firm's research also shows more than half of consumers want to support smaller firms over retail giants. ,Clare Oakey is the co-founder of Frippery Lifestyle Boutique, an independent fashion and homeware retailer in Colchester. ,She and her business partner Kim will spend up to £1,000 on reopening promotional activities, including printing a hundred 10%-off discount vouchers for the local barber to give away, putting flower arrangements and sweets in the shop, and offering customers who make a purchase goodie bags.,Ms Oakey says that five retail chain outlets on the same high street will not be reopening on 12 April, along with a number of independent stores. So even though people in Colchester generally like supporting small retailers, more needs to be done to get the public spending on the High Street again.,""We've prioritised keeping our business open by paying invoices to suppliers to keep the company running long term, but the honest truth is that it's been financially tough on a very personal level for me and my business partner,"" Clare tells the BBC.,""We really badly need the support - any form of help to let us catch up and break even, in terms of a scheme that incentivises the customers. We're nothing without customers."",The only nice thing, she says, is that local independent businesses have come together to help each other out.  ,For example, while the Frippery has been closed in the most recent lockdown, a nearby artisan coffee shop, Sir Isaacs Coffee House, has offered a click-and-collect service on its behalf. ,It meant the Frippery could continue serving its customers online, while the coffee shop got more exposure and hopefully sold a few extra coffees.,Retail analysts are also seriously concerned about the situation facing Britain's independent shops.,""Independent retailers have had a tumultuous year and immediate action is needed to avoid a high street apocalypse,"" says Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail.,A Shop Out to Help Out Scheme would encourage consumers to ""ditch their screens"" and support their local shops, she says.,""This is a unique opportunity to redefine our high streets, but without government support we'll be bracing for a retail bloodbath."",Retail expert Kate Hardcastle agrees, pointing out that independent retailers were the ones who ""really demonstrated their worth"" in the early days of the pandemic in coming to their communities' aid when other retailers didn't have their online shopping offerings ready.,She is concerned that everyone will forget about them now.,""Just telling people to shop small as has been previous campaigns might serve as a reminder, not an action,"" she tells the BBC.,""Just as the case was with Eat Out to Help Out, we need to see our government support small businesses longer term.,""I'd love to see initiatives to make it easier for small businesses to open up on the High Street and rejuvenate."",She says the collaborative approach used by the Frippery and its neighbours is the right one: ""The future of small businesses has to be one of collaboration and not feeling they have to justify their worth to consumers all the time, but being able to focus on a brilliant offer because they can afford to survive."",A Treasury spokesman said: ""We've supported retailers across the UK though out the outbreak, protecting millions of jobs - and will continue to do so in the months ahead. ,""Shops won't pay any business rates until July, can continue to furlough staff until September, and are receiving Restart Grants of up to £6,000.""",business

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56570364,AstraZeneca vaccine - was it really worth it?,"That was the view from one of the biggest institutional investors in the UK. ,It's not a view the pharmaceutical giant and its talismanic boss Pascal Soriot would have expected to hear, having developed a safe, effective vaccine at breakneck speed, signing contracts to deliver nearly two billion doses and doing it all without making a profit. ,Mr Soriot could be forgiven perhaps for thinking he would be getting a medal.,Instead he is getting brickbats from EU politicians like Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, who has accused the company of dishonesty and arrogance, in the way he alleges, it has ""over-promised and under-delivered"". ,Some are suggesting that the whole endeavour has been more trouble than it is worth. ,AstraZeneca has foregone over $20bn (£14.5bn) in revenue, while becoming a household name in the EU and the US for all the wrong reasons. ,Some investors have even questioned Pascal Soriot's position as chief executive. ,Astra has become a political football in a European blame game. ,One minute his compatriot, the French President Emmanuel Macron, is describing the vaccine as ""quasi-ineffective"", and the next, President Macron is volunteering to have the jab himself and backing a move to block exports outside the EU. ,Oxford University's Sir John Bell said Mr Soriot was mystified by the French approach: ""He's found dealing with the French one of the most difficult things he's had to do, because they have been so completely irrational."",There was also widespread anti-Astra outrage when a raid on an Italian pharmaceutical plant discovered a stash of nearly 30 million vaccines - only for it to dissipate when the company said that 16 million of them were for EU use and the rest were headed for poorer countries under an EU-backed program called Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax). ,In the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), accused AstraZeneca of ""unforced errors"", in failing to include the most recent data in its trial submissions to US authorities. ,Even insiders admit: ""It's fair to say we are in a pretty uncomfortable spot right now."",As one investor told the BBC, ""[Pascal Soriot is] discovering what happens when you are doing politics, rather than business"". ,The story of AstraZeneca's adventures in vaccines and politics is impossible to separate from the background of the man in charge. ,As one of his competitors put it: ""Astra is Pascal's company, it's hard to tell where Pascal Soriot ends and AstraZeneca starts."" ,That is pretty unusual for a public company owned by huge institutional investors around the world.,Although he took over in 2012, Mr Soriot's dominant and hitherto unassailable position stemmed from his successful defence of the company from a $100bn takeover bid from American drug giant Pfizer in 2014. ,""When he took over, Astra was in a bit of a mess and he took some big risks investing in more R&D - so when Pfizer came along he felt vindicated,"" said one insider.,""He thought if Pfizer wanted to buy it, I must be on the right track"".  ,Mr Soriot used every defence trick in the book, including playing the British heritage card. Britain would be losing decades of science leadership historically and into the future. ,He styled himself as the bringer of cures, rather than corporate cost savings. ,The politicians of the day loved him for it - Sir Vince Cable, then-Business Secretary in David Cameron's Conservative Lib Dem coalition government remembers: ""Despite the fact the takeover would have put extra money in shareholders' pockets short-term, he and his directors stuck to their guns. ,""They took the view that it was a long-term project and they've been absolutely and completely vindicated and it's become a major national asset."",This episode cemented the affection of his staff, the respect and thanks of UK politicians, as well as an unshakeable personal self-belief. That last one can sometime be a double edged sword for any boss. ,AstraZeneca does not and has never had much experience with vaccines. Their strength is in treating cancer. ,So when Covid hit, AstraZeneca  was not necessarily the company many thought would lead the charge. ,There was talk of a tie-up between Oxford University and US pharmaceutical giant Merck, but the UK government was keen that Oxford should partner with a UK firm to establish a strong vaccine capability within the UK. ,It made sense for AstraZeneca as Oxford University had done a lot of the heavy research lifting - much of it funded by the UK government. ,When the initial results came in, there was an atmosphere of euphoria. Astra and Oxford would help save the world with a safe, effective and cheap vaccine, supplied at cost to the world. ,It doesn't get more pro-bono than that. This was arguably the high point. ,Since then, AstraZeneca has had a fraught relationship with regulators and politicians; its name has been unfairly but undoubtedly caught up in recriminations over a slow vaccine rollout in the EU; and the share price is 20% lower than it was last summer when the news flow seemed so positive. ,The problem is that manufacturing vaccines is really difficult. ""It's a bit like brewing beer,"" said an insider. ,""Some batches work better than others, and when you add in the complexity of regional supply chains, things get complicated and sometimes don't work."",So, if that's the case, is it not naïve at best and misleading at worst, to promise to deliver a fixed quantity of a potentially life or death product?,The insider added: ""We signed a contract on a best efforts' basis and we used our best efforts."",This is where Astra's lack of experience in vaccines really tripped it up - managing expectations through simple and effective communication. ,From the start, its efficacy numbers were hard to grasp, with separate numbers for different age groups. ,Questions were asked over sample sizes in over 65s and efficacy numbers submitted to US regulators had to be revised down when more up-to-date results were included. ,None of these made much of a difference to the overall picture - one of a safe and effective vaccine - but it fostered an impression the company was not being entirely competent, or entirely honest.,One source told the BBC that ""if you looked on an organisational chart of AstraZeneca, the box labelled vaccine management wouldn't have much in it"".,The company has already said it will review the status of its ""not-for-profit"" stance on its vaccine work when current contracts have been fulfilled. ,But Sir John says he can't blame the firm, ""given the way they have been treated"". ,A major investor suggested that when the contracts are fulfilled, this could be a moment the management review whether they want to be in the business at all. ,""Maybe that's the time to offer up the patent and move on,"" the investor said. The company says this is not their current thinking.,Trying to save the world has taken up a lot of the management's time and energy, at a time when the pharmaceutical giant is in the process of buying a US company for $40bn and a Japanese firm for $7bn. ,That would be enough of a to-do list for any chief executive under normal circumstances. ,But any thought that this vaccine mission could be both Mr Soriot's legacy and his epitaph seems very premature. ,One big investor pointed out that Mr Soriot will earn a lot of ""brownie points"" for taking on something so ambitious and delivering a vaccine that works. ,""He gets extra brownie points on the Environment Social and Governance (ESG) scorecard and he is still the person who turned around a company that was a mess when he took over,"" said the investor.,""I don't sense knives are being sharpened for him yet."",The lasting legacy of this French businessman may end up being making AstraZeneca a household name of which the UK, at least, seems genuinely proud.

It is currently carrying 18,300 containers.,The ship is operated by Taiwanese transport company Evergreen Marine and is one of the world's largest container vessels.,It became stranded on Tuesday, after running aground and becoming lodged sideways across the waterway. At first ,. ,The wind speed at the time was recorded at 40 knots, but the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) told reporters that this was not the only reason for the ship becoming stranded.,An investigation would be needed to determine whether technical or human errors occurred, the authority added. ,As of Sunday, there were 369 ships stuck in a tailback waiting to pass through the 193km (120-mile) canal on either side of the blockage.,Meanwhile, there have been more than 145,200 social interactions on Twitter using the  , hashtag and at least 133,000 shares, according to real-time analysis by brand monitoring platform BrandMentions. ,Over the weekend, 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it and were able to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right"".,​Then on Monday morning, after several reports that the ship had been partially refloated, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) issued a statement saying that the Ever Given had been ""successfully refloated"".,The SCA said it would resume manoeuvres later on Monday high tide, ""allowing for the full restoration of the vessel's direction so it is positioned in the middle of the navigable waterway"".,Then at 13:05 GMT the Ever Given was finally fully freed.,However, it could take a while to clear the backlog of ships waiting to use the canal.,Richard Mead, managing editor of shipping journal Lloyd's List, told the BBC's Today Programme:  ""We're looking at about 450 ships still waiting to transit the canal. It's going to be a lengthy process clearing that backlog."",About 12% of global trade, around one million barrels of oil and roughly 8% of liquefied natural gas pass through the canal each day.,SCA chairman Osama Rabie on Saturday that the Canal's revenues were taking a $14m-$15m (£10.2m-£10.9m) hit for each day of the blockage.,Prior to the pandemic, trade passing through the Suez Canal contributed to 2% of Egypt's GDP, according to Moody's.,Separately, data from Lloyd's List showed the stranded ship was , along the waterway each day. That equates to $400m and 3.3 million tonnes of cargo an hour, or  $6.7m a minute.,Looking at the bigger picture, German insurer Allianz said on Friday its analysis showed the blockage could cost global trade between $6bn to $10bn a week and reduce annual trade growth by 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points.,Shipping broker Braemar ACM told the , that the cost of renting some vessels to ship cargo to and from Asia and the Middle East had jumped 47% to $2.2m. ,Some vessels have been rerouted to avoid the Suez Canal.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56564717,Credit Suisse and Nomura warn of hedge fund hit to profits,"Switzerland's second-biggest bank Credit Suisse said it could have a ""highly significant"" impact on its next quarterly results.,Japan's Nomura said it could make a $2bn (£1.4bn) loss from a US client.,Both have been hit by problems at hedge fund Archegos, which led to the sale of billions of pounds of shares on Friday.,Hedge funds make money buying and selling shares. It is thought that Archegos made some large investments in certain companies that started to go wrong, and its backers then insisted it raise money in a hurry, in what is known as a margin call, prompting some unusually large share sales.,A margin call is when a bank asks a client to put up more funds if a trade partly funded with borrowed money has dropped steeply. ,If they can't afford to do that, the lender will sell the shares to try to recover what it is owed.,Companies caught up in the selling spree include big names such as ViacomCBS, Discovery, Tencent, Baidu, and UK online retailer Farfetch.  ,Investors in both banks have been rattled, Credit Suisse shares are down 14% and Nomura's closed down 16% on the Japanese stock market. ,Fears over who else might be affected by the matter has prompted falls in the shares of other banks, including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, although by far smaller amounts.,Credit Suisse's fortunes are already facing a hit from its lending to Greensill Capital, the finance firm whose collapse has put at risk the future of the UK's Liberty Steel.,, Credit Suisse said: ""A significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls made last week by Credit Suisse and certain other banks. ,""Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions.,""While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results."",Neither named Archegos Capital Management, which, although not a household name, is a big player in US markets. ,It is the family investment firm of Bill Hwang, who was banned in 2014 from trading in Hong Kong, and in 2012 settled insider trading charges in the US.,The surprise default of a US hedge fund will send shivers through world stock markets. Traders will inevitably recall the demise two decades ago of Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that was one of the darlings of Wall Street only to collapse in the late 1990s. So big and complicated was its trading book that a bailout had to be organised among the US financial industry's biggest players, but before they stepped in there was a period of horrible uncertainty over whether the fund's demise might cause a large market crash.,At first sight Archegos does not look to be another LTCM - it is much smaller, and it appears to have been managing the money only of its founder and traders rather than for external investors. But one of the lessons of the 2008 crash is that the financial world is deeply interconnected, and it is difficult to gauge exactly what risks and trading positions individual hedge funds have built up. ,One of the curiosities of Archegos's default is that it was set up by Bill Hwang, a trader with a chequered past - he was banned from the Hong Kong market in 2014. Why banks like Credit Suisse and Nomura chose to have substantial business with his firm will be a subject of great interest to both institutions' senior management and shareholders.",business

The film was funded by nine European countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina. ,""When we started on the film five years ago it looked like mission impossible,"" Žbanić explains. ,""Bosnia doesn't have a film industry. We produce around one film a year, with a budget of around €1m (£850,000). But this film, partly because of the extras we needed, would cost at least four times that and so had to be a co-production with other countries. ,""This is also a sensitive and painful topic, and as soon as we mentioned the word 'genocide', many people shied away, saying, 'It's too difficult.' Now I think, no, it's you who thinks an audience doesn't want to see difficult things.,""The awards nominations are such an incredible honour. A director always hopes their story will reach people's hearts in big numbers, and now we have the Bafta and Oscar nominations, I know how many more people will now see the movie."",One inspiration for the film was the book Under the UN Flag: The International Community and the Srebrenica Genocide by Hasan Nuhanović, but the director describes the main character of Aida as ""a combination of many people we met or read about"".,""Hasan was an interpreter who was there at Srebrenica and his family was expelled from the space,"" she explains. ""So I did approach him, but it was hard for him to have a film based upon him, and also I wanted a woman as the main character, who wanted to protect her sons and her husband. In the development there were many women as inspiration whose sons were at Srebrenica."",Kaouther Ben Hania's film, The Man Who Sold His Skin, stars Yahya Mahayni as Sam, a Syrian refugee who agrees to make himself into a human canvas and be displayed around European galleries. Italian actress Monica Bellucci has a supporting role as a gallery owner. ,The story is inspired by the ,, who agreed for his back to be tattooed by Belgian artist Wim Delvoye and then sold to a German art collector.,The director says she wants to show audiences how hard it is for a refugee to move around the world, compared with the movement of goods.,""It's not only easier for art to move around, it's easier for everything - for goods, for pasta, for fruits, for perfume, for fashion,"" she argues.,""My purpose is for the audience to live the experience of this refugee, who was a normal human being, but not 'born in the right place', as he says to the artist who meets him. ,""So, I wanted to give the possibility of empathy, to understand the journey of a refugee. But his journey is not a typical refugee journey. We don't have the boat, and it doesn't sink. He becomes a work of art. I wanted this combination between the survival world of the refugee and the luxurious world of contemporary art to make this contrast.,""The art market, like any institution, they have their codes, their way of functioning,"" she adds.

""We never mentioned any female director in the history of film-making, so for four years I learned about genius men. ,""I was 17 when the war started so I didn't have access to many sources.

I can't find pleasure in framing this with my camera."",Ben Hania's previous film, Beauty and the Dogs, premiered in 2017, months before the Harvey Weinstein scandal led to the #MeToo movement. It's the story of a young woman who is raped by male police officers.  ,""I think it's an international experience of women not being heard and not being believed,"" the director says. ""That film is the story of a young woman who is raped by policemen and she has to then go and report her rape to policemen.,""I think it was a very important movie for me to do, because when you are a woman, you face at some point in your life something like this.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56487343,Josh O'Connor: Romeo role 'greatest experience of my career',"Last summer seemed the perfect time for O'Connor and Buckley to prove their talent in a well-known Shakespeare at an important venue. ,O'Connor's career had taken off with two roles - Larry in The Durrells for ITV followed by two seasons in The Crown as Prince Charles. (His successor as Charles is yet to be confirmed.) ,Buckley was in the much-praised Chernobyl then showed her range in the bio-pic Judy, playing the assistant assigned to keep Judy Garland on track in 1960s London.,But like almost everything on the National's schedule for 2020, its version of Romeo and Juliet was under threat as soon as the Covid pandemic hit.,O'Connor recalls ""Friday therapy sessions"" when some of those involved got together to try to work out what lay beyond the fog of Lockdown One. ,""It would be Jessie and myself and the director Simon Godwin and sometimes Fisayo Akinade (who plays Mercutio) and Rufus Norris, who runs the National. They were brilliant at keeping us all involved and motivated.,""But when they first came to us about making it a film instead, I think for both of us the reaction was absolutely not - not a chance mate. It just didn't seem the right idea. So thank goodness we followed through and engaged with it as a project.',The film is pacy, lasting just 90 minutes. It was shot over 17 days on and around the National's Lyttelton stage. In normal times the auditorium has an audience capacity of 890 but the seats remained empty.,Director Simon Godwin uses the stage and the areas around it like a film studio - in no way does it feel just like a play taped for TV. The production is fluid and well-lit and it works well.,O'Connor says when their Romeo and Juliet pivoted into a film they both pitched ideas on how it should be done. ""We brought in films to discuss and we talked about how we could make it theatrical and yet not shy away from the cinematic nature of what we were doing. ,""We always knew we wanted to include the building in some way. It lends a texture and tapestry to what you see. So there was a lot to think through but once we really got into it it was the greatest experience of my career. I was having the time of my life."",Buckley is from Killarney in south-west Ireland. She had read Shakespeare at secondary school but didn't see a production until she came to the UK to train as an actor.,""When I first read Shakespeare in Ireland I couldn't get my head around it at all and to be honest I didn't really enjoy it. But later at Rada (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) in London I did a four-week Shakespeare course and that was the first time I felt a massive love-bomb had gone off."",The play is both love story and tragedy. Although from feuding families, Romeo and Juliet fall passionately in love.  A scheme is devised to keep them together which involves Juliet being induced into a death-like coma.  This does not end well. ,Some productions contrast the dark tragedy against sun-filled Italian settings. But Buckley says there are occasions when excitement comes from limitations imposed on the actors and director. ,""Obviously we ended up doing our production in a way no one had expected. But there was a lovely intimacy to being in the Lyttelton."",She thinks the empty seats helped. ""The theatre was our friend because we knew it was there just a few feet away behind this iron curtain even when we couldn't see it. To me it represented the world beyond the small world Romeo and Juliet live in in Verona. ,""Normally when you're doing theatre you'll always be aware of the audience. Maybe it's someone coughing or whatever but in any case you can't not feel them there and even filming you think of their presence."",Both actors enjoyed the forcible merging of the worlds of theatre and film-making, which generally remain pretty separate. O'Connor says everyone on the project was learning a lot from everyone else.,'There were eureka moments - thinking of course, '""Well why wouldn't the cinematographer be in on rehearsals? Why shouldn't the script supervisor be talking to the dialect coach?' Those kind of relationships felt beautiful and magical. It would be so great if that sort of experimentation continued."",Shakespeare most likely wrote Romeo and Juliet in 1595 at a time when roles on stage were always taken by men and boys. In the text Juliet is described as 13 and usually it's assumed Romeo is a little older. ,Neither O'Connor nor Buckley is trying to come across on screen as a teenager. He thinks the youthfulness of Romeo and Juliet can be a hindrance.,""It makes you lazy because you simply accept the idea they somehow just fall in love and they're naïve and that's all there is to it - they're ready to die for each other because it's first love and they don't realise you can fall in love again. ,""In stripping ourselves of all that you can look at the story in other ways. What if death to them represents hope or everlasting love or being together in the afterlife?"",In the UK there are the first tentative signs of theatre awakening from its own year-long sleep as the fight against coronavirus bears fruit - though everyone in the theatre is aware similar optimism last autumn proved misplaced. ,A few venues have now announced reopening dates, and the National hopes to resume live performances on 16 June with Under Milk Wood in its Olivier Theatre. ,But if O'Connor and Buckley could return to live theatre soon, is there another Shakespeare they'd want to take on? Buckley says she'd love to tackle Isabella in Measure for Measure. For O'Connor it's Richard II.,""But if it was with Jessie again I think we'd make bloody good Macbeths one day - it would be a barrel of laughs. But maybe we should wait until we're a bit older.""",arts_culture

They were all written to someone called Reno Martin by drag queens working in the New York scene in the 1950s.,""I love the art of drag,"" Olsen adds. ""I love that art form, and I do believe had anyone else found them, they'd have gone into the trash. Myself and the filmmakers knew they were bigger than just reading them round a dinner table with friends; they needed to be shared with the world."",Olsen and the film's co-directors Jennifer Tiexiera and Michael Seligman - a writer and producer on Ru Paul's Drag Race - managed to track down several of the authors of the letters, who were all now in their 80s and 90s and living across the United States.,""The youngest was 84 and the oldest was 96,"" Tiexiera remembers, ""and we were asking them about events that happened 60 years ago, but they were so alive, so mentally alert, and they remembered everything."",The film, which is showing at the ,, intersperses narrated extracts from the letters, many of them from a Daphne or a Josephine. Archive video and photos also feature, with interviewees recounting their experience of drag culture and queer life in 50s and 60s New York. ,They worked at drag balls and in nightclubs, including one, Club 82, which the filmmakers discovered had mafia links, yet was so famous that celebrities including the Kennedys and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were attendees. ,But it was only inside that tolerance was extended to the performers, Olsen says. ""It was a spectacle and a form of entertainment but outside of that, it was not ok,"" he points out.,Social historians who are interviewed in the film stress the importance of the letters, saying much of their research is based upon police and hospital records, due to the treatment of the gay community at the time.,""There's been very little education on this, and how the drag art form has come about,"" says Olsen. ""It was illegal to be in drag in the USA at the time. If you were caught masquerading as a woman, you'd get six months to a year in prison. They were living a dangerous life."",Some of the letter writers prefer to be called ""female impersonators"" on screen, rather than ""drag queens"" - which Tiexiera says she hopes ""might lead to education on what people want to be called, and how language changes over time."",Even within the gay community of 1950s New York, Craig Olsen describes the interviewees as ""a minority within a minority."" ,""To some in the gay community, drag has been viewed as a fetish, but actually it's an art form,"" he argues. ""And what if you were told you couldn't do your art? What are you left with?"",Tiexiera says the success of a reality TV show such as Ru Paul's Drag Race, which has just finished its ,, was greeted with incredulity by their interviewees.,""We asked our subjects about it,"" she recalls, ""and across the board, they all said they never thought they'd be alive to see drag artists on television, and it blows their mind. To be doing what they were doing, they had to be unapologetically themselves and had to be insanely bold. They were embarrassing to their peers. ,""We also take a couple of our subjects to the NYC Drag March, and the reason there is one is that drag queens were not allowed to the gay Pride march at the time."" ,Club 82 is in the process of being restored as a landmark of LGBT history, and the filmmakers also hope at some point to physically reunite their interviewees.  ,Tiexiera adds that these octogenarians and nonagenarians were still largely unaware that they were pioneers.,""I don't think they have any regrets at all about their lives, they all said they needed to be happy and would have done the same things over again,"" she says. ""They just had to be true to themselves, and kept saying to us, 'I don't know why you guys want to tell this story.',""I hope there's a couple of takeaways from the film,"" she adds. ""Scour your attics and basements and talk to your elders. The youth now really needs to record their history, particularly trans youth. ,""I feel very little exists for these communities, and it's so important to have this reference point of who they are and where they come from. In the 1950s, so much was destroyed from this time period because it was considered so shameful."",Olsen adds: ""I just think it's important to know that these kinds of letters do not exist in any archive in the USA, and that's what makes them so special.,""It's the only thing out there that shows this period for queer life.""",arts_culture

We rallied around Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones; we thought that was an act of white rebellion. And then, of course, Bob Marley, Big Youth and Desmond Dekker."" ,In Exodus, Marley sings about walking through ""roads of creation"".,Farrukh says: ""We always thought of ourselves as the generation that would walk through creation, that would change the world. As you get mature you realise that it's a valid ambition - but it's a dream.""  ,For Leila Hassan Howe, Black Power was not just a social movement for freedom and peace, but a ""fight for rights and equal justice"". ,""If there was an anthem which really expressed the militancy, that was Blood and Fire by Niney and Big Youth,"" she says. ,""Marley's War reminded me of the international link of the movement, because he talks about people in Zimbabwe, Angola, Mozambique... and he performed this song in Africa."" ,Music was big in the UK in the 70s, and Leila says: ""You're hearing James Brown, Marvin Gaye. You are hearing all this wonderful music, and then Curtis Mayfield would come on and there was just a different atmosphere.

""I describe the civil rights movement as the pain in my heart; I describe Malcolm X as my liberation, because they [American activists] had the ability to express what was in our hearts,"" explains Zainab.,For her, Gil Scott-Heron's The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is a Black Power must, and Zainab recalls him giving her a pile of free tickets to distribute to black people to see his concert in London. ,She adds: ""Bob Marley and his Redemption Song didn't come out until 1980, but that song has the best line ever.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-56428543,Not just the Proms: An unexpected history of the Royal Albert Hall,"On the 150th anniversary of its opening, its archive manager Liz Harper insists ""the idea of it being an elitist venue is just not true,"" describing it as the ""nation's village hall"" because of its eclectic events and occupants.,So, from the flushed faces of middle England bobbing beneath their Union Jacks to the flushed lavatories reinforced for Sumo competitors, here are some of the Royal Albert Hall's highs and lows over the past century and a half.,Prince Albert, along with Henry Cole - a civil servant with a passion for art and industrial design - organised 1851's hugely popular ,; a world fair which was held in Hyde Park.,The profits of that were used to buy land and develop institutions in South Kensington, including the Natural History Museum, the V&A, and Imperial College. ,The centrepiece of this area of academia and aestheticism was a giant hall, the manifestation of Prince Albert's idea of a hub where people could gather and share ideas. At the opening ceremony on 29 March 1871, Queen Victoria was overcome by emotion (she was not amused), and her son the Prince of Wales had to speak on her behalf.  ,Money was raised for construction by selling tickets in advance. The first 20 were bought by Queen Victoria. They still make up the royal box. ,The building was designed by engineers rather than architects, with the emphasis placed firmly on functionality. Taking almost four years to build, it ,""Even when it first opened, people said it wasn't the most beautiful,"" explains Ms Harper.,""But as a functional public building I think it's stood the test of time."" ,It was far from plain sailing. During the first few years, the hall hosted various events with mixed success. ,Ms Harper says popular shows included huge thousand-person choirs: ""It was before the age of microphones so it would really have been a wall of sound - and it was those things which really were crowd-pleasers"", as were penny subscription concerts, where people would pay 1d to attend a series of concerts.,Other shows ""just seem nuts now"", Ms Harper says. In March 1891, the hall was altered to resemble a city inspired by Lord Lytton's science fiction story,, (,) in which Earth is threatened by a winged master race called Vril-ya. ,Thought to be the first ever sci-fi convention, exhibitors included a fortune-telling dog, various Vril-themed magic shows, and mannequins representing the Vril-ya.,The novel was exceedingly popular with Victorians, who were quick to dress in costume for the event, with many donning wings. A more down-to-earth element was provided by possibly the longest-lasting legacy of the futuristic story: Bovril.,Worn-out attendees could pep themselves up with a cup of the hot beef extract, which had a display stall at the convention.,Its inventor named the drink by combining the words ""bovine"" and ""Vril"". It was intended to symbolise the energy a mug of the salty blood-based liquid would give the drinker, and was probably an improvement on its original name of ""Johnston's Fluid Beef"". ,Never ones to do things by half, the Victorians also put on massive fetes, including one where they built a normal-sized church in the auditorium. The 1911 Shakespeare Memorial Ball saw the auditorium transformed with green lawns and real flowers, leading a rather star-struck newspaper reporter to write ""never has the effect of a fancy dress ball, taken as a whole, been more wonderful or more complete"".,Costume Balls proved a good money-spinner - the first was held in 1883 by a London gentleman's club The Savage Club, and Chelsea Arts Club Balls happened annually from 1910 until 1958.  ,Renowned for their exuberance and extravaganza, thousands of revellers dressed in historic or exotic outfits and cavorted on carnival floats driven around inside the huge auditorium.,The great hall hosted a number of ground-breaking events - not just the first sci-fi convention.,What is thought to be the world's debut bodybuilding contest, in 1901, saw 60 competitors trying to prove to a group of three judges who had the brawniest muscles. ,Britain's first indoor marathon was held in December 1909, when two athletes - Italian Dorando Pietri and London-based C W Gardiner - attempted to run 524 laps of the auditorium.,Only Gardiner finished the race, completing the course in 2 hours and 37 minutes.,The first table tennis World Championship was played at the venue for five days in January 1938.,And the first sumo wrestling tournament held outside Japan in the sport's 1,500-year history took place in the hall in October 1991, an event that necessitated the reinforcement of chairs, installation of extra-large showers and the weight-testing of toilets.,As is to be expected, a venue that attracted such a range of events also pulled in the famous faces. Slightly oddly, the Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a judge for the rippling hunks in the bodybuilding competition. ,He also sort-of turned up from beyond the grave. A séance was held days after his death in July 1930, in which a clairvoyant tried to contact him in front of an audience of 10,000 people and his widow, Jean.,Apparently her husband was reached, he passed on a message, and Lady Conan Doyle was ""perfectly convinced"" by the experience,  which she found both ""cheering and encouraging"".,John Lennon appeared at the hall a few times - on one occasion triggering members of the audience to exhibit more than perhaps planned. In 1968 he and wife Yoko Ono put on a display called Alchemical Wedding, in which they sat in a large white bag while a man played a flute. ,Some of the crowd showed their appreciation by getting naked in the auditorium.,Fortunately clothes were on the menu in November 1985, which saw the arrival of Fashion Aid, a star-studded fashion-based off-shoot of Band Aid. It culminated with a fake runway wedding between Queen singer Freddie Mercury and actress Jane Seymour.,Not just the perfect place for the peculiar, the hall has seen its fair share of politics. Suffragists, suffragettes and anti-suffrage campaigners all rallied in the hall, which the suffragettes named their ""Temple of Liberty"".  ,It was where Emmeline Pankhurst famously announced: ""I incite this meeting to rebellion. Be militant each in your own way. I accept the responsibility for everything you do."",""Lots of things have come forward from the hall to make wider social changes,"" says Ms Harper.,""It was the largest venue where they could hire and it was where they raised the most funding. ,""Women would literally take off their jewellery, their rings, their necklaces to put in the offering which was going round"".,The Suffragettes also have the dubious honour of becoming the first political group to be banned from the hall after some of the trustees became concerned that Pankhurst's call for militancy could lead to trouble.,The auditorium was also the destination for several large meetings held by the British Union of Fascists during the 1930s. The Times newspaper reported that at one, in March 1935, the aisles were filled with Blackshirt squads who beat drums and sounded bugles. ,Ms Harper says the current booking system is comparatively strict. ""Back then, as long as they didn't damage the hall, the trustees would take a booking from them because they needed revenue"". ,Pop and rock was once officially banned from the venue after performances by bands like Mott The Hoople and The Nice saw people ripping down curtains and breaking through the floor in the boxes.,Ms Harper says this meant the hall ""wasn't quite the really exciting place"" it had been in the 1950s and 1960s.,""You'd had these big counter-culture poetry gatherings, and massive rock gigs with Jimi Hendrix. And then in the 1970s you just had artists who were more like crooners"".,The ban was never officially lifted but as the management changed, the bands gradually returned.,In addition to indoor marathons and sumo wrestling, sport has played an important part at the hall, with tennis championships, boxing matches and table tennis championships all being held inside the hall.,The pandemic has delayed the hall's , but chief executive Craig Hassall says he wants the programme to reflect the essence of what Prince Albert had planned all those years ago.,The Proms will return, along with their last night flag-waving. Both classical and pop ,, as are ballet performances, ballroom dancing competitions and gala evenings.,Or maybe Arthur Conan Doyle will make another return from beyond the veil - and this time he might be joined by some other Royal Albert Hall ghosts. Perhaps John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, Emmeline Pankhurst and Queen Victoria could share a nice cup of fortifying ""fluid beef"".",arts_culture

https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56270058,Scalping: The teens making thousands selling consoles online,"That's just what 18-year-old Jake (not his real name) has lying around in his bedroom.,He's part of a growing number of ""scalpers"" - people using online bots to buy and sell in-demand items. ,It's led to politicians and gamers to call for a law to ban their use.,The word was first used to describe buying up large quantities of tickets for stuff like gigs and festivals and then selling them on, pocketing the profit.,Ticket scalpers would often use bots, which are bits of computer software that can scan the internet much faster than any person.,In 2018, following a campaign that had support from artists like , and The Arctic Monkeys, the UK government , to buy tickets illegal.,But using bots to buy up other in-demand items like consoles and gym equipment is still allowed by law.,And this, along with the closure of shops because of the pandemic, has created a perfect environment for scalpers to start buying and selling everything from consoles to hot tubs. ,Jake says he doesn't know how much money he's made from scalping - but the numbers are big.,""I honestly don't keep track. Maybe £10,000 since November,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.,It's something he's been doing for a few years, starting with buying and selling designer trainers like Yeezys and Jordans. ,But now he's graduated to selling more profitable items.,""At the start when stock was limited, you could easily sell a PS5 for £800,"" he says.,That's nearly double the recommended retail price.,And it's one of the reasons why many gamers haven't been able to get their hands on new consoles such as the PS5 and the Xbox Series X since their release. ,Ryan is one of them.,The 26-year-old dad from Cambridge has been trying to get his hands on the new PlayStation but says the whole experience has been ""stressful, frustrating and painful"". ,He says his best mate managed to buy one at 1:45am when they went on sale but for Ryan, ""most of us are in bed by then, because we've got to get up for work or we've got kids. I've got no chance in hell of getting one.,""It's just frustrating,"" Ryan says. ""I saw someone posted a picture of 15 stacked up in their hallway selling them for £600 each."",Christina has been trying to buy a console for her autistic brother. ,She waited in a virtual queue for nearly two hours and when she got to the front everything had sold out. ,""It's pretty frustrating,"" she says.,The scalpers, however, say, ""it's just business."",One of those is 17-year-old Sam, who's currently applying to universities. ,""I am probably the only 17-year-old with no Snapchat, TikTok or Facebook,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.,While others her age are - as she puts it - ""out breaking lockdown rules"", she's chatting on Discord, an app that has become popular with bot users, where she runs a business that's earning her over £2,000 a month. ,""I'm not a scammer,"" she says. ""I'm an entrepreneur of sorts.,""The reality is we buy stock, we own it, we can set the price. Some of the people in these groups do this to feed their families."",What about Jake?,""I don't sound like a very nice person,"" he says, ""but it's business isn't it?,""Why should I be sitting in my bedroom playing video games like every other 18-year-old, not doing anything with their life? ,""It's easy money, it's pocket money."" ,But there's a darker side to making money from flogging consoles online.,And for Sam that comes in the form of threats of violence.,""People have said I should be stabbed and left to bleed in the street,"" she says.,The only one she's bothered to report threatened to rape her because ""it's what I deserve"".,Sam says she hasn't reported the others to the police because she'd be wasting her time.,""Girls online get it all the time,"" she says. ""When people are behind a screen with a keyboard they say all sorts."" ,Jake's also received threatening messages.,""A lot of them are grown men in their 30s and 40s - for all they know I could be 16 and they're threatening me."",So what's being done to help gamers like Ryan?,It's complaints like his that have led politicians to get involved, including Douglas Chapman, who's an SNP MP.,Last week he put forward something called a private members bill - which is , from someone not in government - to ban bots from buying up items online. It's the second time he's done so in Parliament.,""It's not in the interest of ordinary consumers,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ,""If you wanted a PS5 for Christmas but you didn't get one, it's probably because of bots."",And it's the sheer amount of people who have complained that led Douglas to raise it as in issue in Parliament. ,""There's nothing wrong with trying to make money,"" Douglas says, but there is a ""moral argument"" that people should be paying market price.,The government says it is ""discussing other markets with relevant trade associations"" in response to a petition to make scalping for items other than tickets illegal.,Sam thinks it's likely that ""legislation will likely come in to ban bots"" but she also thinks that ""manual buying will continue"". ,That is - buying up stock online without the help of bots. ,""You're purchasing them the same way as anyone else, then reselling a product you own,"" she says.,""You can't ban commerce."",.",arts_culture
