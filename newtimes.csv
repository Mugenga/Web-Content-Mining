","In a Cassava field just outside Kabunjwiri, a small village in the Gisagara district in rural Rwanda, Claudine is finishing the last stages of harvesting before the rainy season begins in April. She works 8-10 hours a day in the field, and spends another 4-6 hours cooking and doing house chores. Across sub-Saharan Africa, women produce up to 80% of foods for household consumption and sale in local markets, according to a report by the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Women sow the seeds, do the weeding, cultivate and harvest the crops, while they also tend to the aftermath of farming as they sell surpluses in local markets. But despite their indisputable contribution to agriculture in the continent, the gender gap is very noticeable in the sector. Women own less than 1 percent of lands. In the Ethiopian coffee market, for example, women provide 75 per cent of the labor but earn only 34 percent of total income generated.,Agriculture is only one example of the ever present gender inequality that is extremely dominant across Africa. According to the African Development Bank and the UN, the continent’s Gender Equality Index ranges from 24.0% to 79.7%, averaging at 48.6%, while the rest of the world stands at 68.6%.,At work, at home, and in school, inequality is all around,When looking at the labour force, Africa scores ahead of other regions and continents on women’s labour-force participation, but 89.7 percent of employed women work in low-paid jobs in the informal sector, leaving them little hope for advancement, higher wages, or promotions. And while the continent has the highest female representation on company boards of any region, standing at 25 percent (the global average is 17 percent), the share of women in middle management has regressed by 1 percent a year since 2015. Only 15% of formal-sector firms have a woman as the managing director, while 32% have some degree of female ownership. Women account for more than 50 percent of Africa’s combined population, but in 2018 generated only 33 percent of the continent’s collective GDP.,Unpaid care work, including child and elderly care, house chores and more, continues to fall disproportionately on women’s shoulders, as they bear the burden of Africa’s infrastructure deficit. The lack of access to the most basic services, especially power and water, is the main problem, as women and girls spend up to 20 hours a week collecting firewood and water, which over the course of a year, can represent up to two months of labour.,In terms of education, finance, and technology women are left far behind, with financial inclusion steadily declining since 2017. In terms of education, there is progress in primary level parity between girls and boys, but it is non-existent in the secondary level, as most of the girls are still pulled out of school to help with house chores and labour. Women are 34 percent less likely than men to have a smartphone, hindering potential adoption of digital solutions.,In general, Women and girls carry most of the care and domestic burden, are not likely to be employed in the formal sector or earn high wages, do not have access to financial services, and lack proper education levels that could change this predicament.,Despite the vast inequality, women are very active as economic agents, performing the majority of agricultural activities, owning a third of all businesses, and determining the welfare of their families and the life prospects of their children. According to McKinsey,  Africa could add $316 billion or 10 percent to GDP in the period to 2025 if each country makes advances in women’s equality to match the country in the region that has achieved the most progress towards parity. However, At the current rate of progress, Africa could take more than 140 years to achieve gender parity.,The only way forward,As with many other issues and sectors regarding Africa’s needed development, technological advancements could lead entire communities to leapfrog the current gloom situation, and reach a more equal reality. Various solutions are already out there, and many more are currently under development, with COVID19 accelerating innovation in multiple remote fields.,Solar energy and off-grid solutions are the perfect fit for hundreds of millions who are living without infrastructure in their villages and homes, and are already saving women and girls vast amounts of time that was previously spent on house chores including the procurement of combustible fuels, cooking on an open fire, and more. The light is also helping girls spend more time doing school work, as they are finally able to study after dark. As solar energy becomes more accessible across the continent, millions of women are expected to enjoy power in coming years, and according to a recent report by IRENA, sub-Saharan Africa could meet up to 67 percent of its energy needs by 2030, which could prove to be extremely meaningful for gender equality in the region.,Education is getting an added boost from multiple remote services and edtech companies that reach girls everywhere, allowing them to receive global education and gain important skills. In recent years, mobile money providers across the region began offering educational content and made big advancements in the field. According to Markets and Research, the e-learning market is expected to reach $1.8 billion USD by 2024, and COVID19-related lockdowns have established an even greater cause for speeding up development.,Fintech solutions are abundant across Africa, with mobile money in the lead, and other crypto-based, and digital services taking the continent by storm, presenting women with financial inclusion for the first time ever. Digital solutions not only create new opportunities for women to open bank accounts, which was previously limited by cultural and regulatory difficulties, but also allows traveling to long distances without the worry of carrying cash, providing more opportunities to get out of rural areas. A study done in Kenya checking the long-term effects of mobile money found that approximately 185,000 in the country women moved from agriculture to small-scale retail as a result, leading to a higher income and better opportunities for advancement.,Internet connectivity plays a major role in allowing access to these important advancements, and inventive technologies including TV White Space and satellite broadband are providing millions with access, while new ventures alongside the biggest companies in the world including Facebook and Microsoft are working to reach millions more solutions.,It has long been recognized that investing in women and girls is one of the most effective ways of promoting development. Educated women are far more likely to have fewer children, and higher means to provide for them, and the resulting improvement has multiplier effects that expand with each generation. Studies have also found that each year of additional schooling for girls reduces infant mortality by 5-10%, and the children of mothers with five years of primary education are 43% less likely to be malnourished. This is meaningful everywhere, and particularly for a continent expected to double its population in the coming decade. Hopefully, innovative thinkers will continue paving the path to an equal, fair future for all."

","Experts and dealers in cooling appliances have said that thousands of consumers ought to switch to energy-efficient and climate-friendly refrigerators and air conditioners to help Rwanda implement Amendment to cut production of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that are said to be powerful climate-warming gases.,The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which entered into force in 2019 is an international treaty designed to phase out such powerful climate-warming gases by more than 80 percent in the next 30 years.,Once phased out, the gases could reduce 0.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.,Jean Paul Nsengiyumva, the proprietor of Cold Air Ltd that deals in the appliances told Doing Business that there exists cooling appliances on the domestic market which have both environmental and economic benefits.,“Besides consuming less electricity, they do not pollute the air. Going by an example, if someone used to spend 200 grams of cooling gas, the energy-efficient appliances spend around 80 grams. This means that the less cooling gas used, the less power is consumed,” he said.,Aline Uwase, a restaurant owner in Kigali city said that the old fridge she uses consumes half of the power the whole business consumes.,“The government decision to embrace energy-saving cooling appliances is timely. However, there should be a financing mechanism to help people switch to energy-efficient refrigerators because the upfront cost is high. ,Some people do not have knowledge about this energy-saving and climate-friendly refrigerators,” she said.,According to the domestic refrigerating appliance and room air conditioner market and feasibility assessment by Rwanda Cooling Finance Initiative (RCOOL FI), there has been a steady increase in refrigerators in the residential sector since 2012 with an estimated stock of 97,512 refrigerators owned by households in Rwanda as of last year.,Although most of the refrigerators found in households are new with 58.6 per cent bought less than three years ago, there is 36 per cent which are approximately 35,104 households who purchased their refrigerating appliances over four years ago and may still use powerful climate-warming gases.,The largest market potential for refrigerators is in Kigali city, followed by the Southern Province, the Western Province, the Eastern Province, and finally the Northern Province while the air conditioners market at the household level in Rwanda is relatively small.,Also, the findings indicate that the best potential residential market segments are middle-income households with about 66.3 per cent market share- and high-income households with controlling about 23.2 per cent of the market share including micro-entrepreneurs from urban areas controlling about 26.9 per cent.,However, the study revealed there are some financial and technical barriers that would need to be addressed to accelerate the transformation of the market towards energy-efficient cooling equipment.,It shows that some of the barriers affecting household clients in adopting energy efficient refrigerators particularly those who already have old appliances is the high upfront cost.,There is also the aspect of lack of trust that the product will achieve energy as well as lack of awareness on energy savings in the long run.,Technology suppliers, it indicates, face the challenge of financing energy-efficient cooling equipment because they lack suitable financing.,Air conditioners market in Rwanda is less than 30 percent according to studies.,However, 42.3 per cent of suppliers are optimistic that with the introduction of a new financial mechanism, this trend may shift to between 30 and 40 per cent.,The 42.3 per cent of the respondents said that the current market penetration of refrigerator in Rwanda ranges between 61 and 70 per cent but believe with the introduction of a financial mechanism market penetration can increase to between 70 and 80 per cent.,In order to ensure the appliances are energy-efficient and climate-friendly, the National Green Growth and Climate Resilience strategy for climate change and low carbon development and National Cooling strategy are among the potential tools to reduce powerful climate-warming gases used in cooling appliances.,To cut the consumption of powerful climate-warming gases used in cooling appliances, Rwanda has drastically reduced, by 54%, the importation of gases known as ‘hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)’ that deplete the ozone layer paving the way for implementing the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.,Martine Uwera, the National Focal Point of Montreal Protocol, recently told Doing Business that Rwanda has reduced the importation of chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) from 4.1 tonnes in 2010 to 1.89 tonnes currently.,The green growth strategy also highlights that implementation of low energy consumption standards in buildings and services in Rwanda could result in an 80 per cent reduction in energy use.,Studies show that old refrigerators that are not energy-efficient consume an estimated Rwf4 billion power annually of which Rwf2.4bn is an expense that could be saved."

Often, there are registration fees or initial investment for new members received by the organization.  The initial members receive hefty payouts from fees of people in lower ranks rather than the selling of services or products.,You are forced to buy other things you don’t want or need just to stay in good standing with the organization or to receive promotions.,It is common for pyramid schemes to seek to inspire new members through testimonies of the lavish and prosperous lives of initial members in a bid to entice new members to be actively involved in promotional activities. Others boast of having global renowned celebrities as their members in a bid to portray the entities as legitimate. The phrase, “even so and so is our member” is not uncommon in pyramid scheme recruitment process.,The pitches and presentations made to attract members are often largely about prosperity, riches, fortunes and accomplished dreams as opposed to business opportunities and models to be used.,It is not uncommon for new recruits to leave feeling inspired and motivated after the presentation but uncertain about the entity’s business model and approach.,When one conducts due diligence, it is not uncommon to find that the said firm runs business activities in aspects that it is not registered under. It is therefore advisable to conduct due diligence on the registration of business one seeks to enter to confirm the legal registration."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-across-africa-dire-need-larger-momentum,"Covid-19 vaccine rollout across Africa is in dire need of a larger momentum
","This month, Rwanda became the first country in Africa to roll-out the Pfizer-BionTech Covid-19 vaccine, with the help of COVAX. Alongside vaccines arriving in Ghana in late February, this marks the beginning of the continuous efforts of local and international governments together with global organisations and various donors, all trying to find creative solutions for the continent’s vast vaccination needs that are currently far from being met.,According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Africa, like many other developing countries, will not be able to vaccinate health workers, older population, and other vulnerable groups before 2023, and this timeline could extend to 2025 for universal coverage. Therefore, the continent may suffer vastly from the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts due to challenges around vaccine access.,Around the world, socioeconomic effects can be witnessed in multiple areas and sectors, and Africa, albeit the relatively low numbers of cases, is no different. The pandemic caused an estimated 6.1 per cent fall in per-capita income in 2020 and is expected to lead to a further 0.2 per cent decline in 2021, setting average living standards back by a decade or more in a quarter of Sub-Saharan African economies. According to the World Bank, tens of millions are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty.,For oil exporters such as Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, Covid’s impacts aggravated a crisis that began in 2015, with commodity prices falling, global lockdowns resulted in reduced exports for other commodities including iron, cotton, coffee and sugar, travel restrictions have halted tourism and hospitality industries across the continent, and strict national lockdowns since have affected small businesses.,To reach herd immunity and kick start the economy, Africa needs 1.5 billion vaccines, and global efforts to reach that goal are mounting. The most meaningful initiative is currently COVAX, bringing together governments, global health organisations, manufacturers, scientists, private sector, civil society and philanthropy, with the aim of providing vaccines to people in all corners of the world, regardless of their wealth. The facility was the first to deploy vaccines across the continent, with Rwanda, Ghana, and Côte d’Ivoire being the first countries to begin vaccinating their health workers. The African Union has secured 270 million vaccine doses from a mix of sources including Pfizer and BioNTech, Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson. But alongside global and local efforts, challenges are still vast.,Even with hundreds of millions of doses secured by the various entities, wide scale vaccine distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa is facing multiple obstacles, as infrastructure, as always, is insufficient across sectors. Poor transport and distribution systems, weak health systems, and insufficient cold storage systems are a few to name. Widespread distrust is another concern, as vast parts of the population are afraid to get the jab. The cost is another major issue, expected to reach $8-16 billion, with an additional markup of 20-30 percent for program delivery.,There are a number of issues to tackle in the path of reaching adequate vaccination rates across the continent:,Covax participation: today, almost half of Africa’s 55 countries are participating in the COVAX facility. Participation should grow to strengthen pooled bargaining power and ensure wider access to the global vaccine supply.,Secure other paths for vaccines: COVAX promised access to vaccines for up to 20% of participating countries’ population. As herd immunity currently requires at least 60% of the population to be vaccinated, countries across the continent must look for other ways to access more doses, including direct agreements with big pharma producers, and national R&D.,Allocate more funds to in house Research: in a recently published Covid-19 Vaccine Development and Access Strategy, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) set accelerating local involvement in research and development as the leading key objective. Today, only 2% of clinical trials conducted worldwide occur in Africa. Investments in research and development will ultimately lead to increased efficacy of vaccines for populations across the continent, as can be seen in India. For example, Nigerian laboratory announced the development of a 90% effective vaccine back in September in the preclinical trial but it has not been able to carry out clinical trials due to lack of support and funding.,Invest in rural infrastructure: in rural, last-mile communities, as well as in large cities across the SSA region, electricity is unreliable, and often non-existent, leaving solar power as the only path to reach full immunisation. Added efforts should be taken to fast-track deployment of off-grid solar electrification solutions, with a focus on local healthcare centers that could use the power to properly store vaccines. Since 2018, and long before Covid was ever an issue, UNICEF, alongside local governments and Gavi, began buying and installing solar-powered vaccine-storage fridges throughout the region, supporting vaccination efforts for various diseases.,Finally, continued global support is crucial in reaching adequate immunisation rates. Wealthy countries and donor organizations must continue their support, while private companies working across the continent should ramp up efforts to expand solar solutions, last mile delivery technologies, and cold storage devices.,The road to Covid eradication is still long, and Africa is facing a longer path than most. With focused efforts on multiple accounts millions of lives can be saved., The writer is an entrepreneur and investor, leading sustainability-driven companies in Africa and the Middle East"

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/oecds-updated-guidance-tax-treaties-and-impact-covid-19,"OECD’s updated guidance on tax treaties and the impact of Covid-19
","The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted every part of our lives – tax treaties have not been immune to this impact.,Earlier this year, the OECD issued updated guidance on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on tax treaties. This guidance is intended to provide further certainty to taxpayers as it reiterates most of its original guidance issued in April 2020, a few months after the pandemic broke out.,A number of countries have also issued their own guidance to provide certainty to taxpayers who could be impacted by their own tax treaties or domestic tax legislation – most countries have followed the OECD guidance.,The guidance applies only to situations arising during the pandemic and it is, therefore, temporary in nature, seeking to avoid instances of double taxation whilst ensuring that it is not relied upon to create instances of double non-taxation.,1. The creation of a permanent establishment (‘PE’) and the interruption of construction sites;,2. Changes in residence for entities and individuals;,3. Income from employment.,The main theme of these guidelines is that, in view of the fact these changes are exceptional and temporary, they should not create adverse tax consequences for the taxpayer. This may be seen in the ‘Home Office’ section of the guidance which states that in order for a home office to be deemed to be a PE, it must have a degree of permanence and be at the disposal of the enterprise. The ‘degree of permanence’ will not be met if the home office has simply been created as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, as individuals working from home are typically doing so as a result of public health emergencies.,However, it is likely that a number of companies will allow employees to work from home even once the pandemic is over. One needs to look at the facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether such home office will result in a PE for the enterprise post-Covid 19, as this could result in a material tax consequences for the enterprise.,A matter of great concern is also the impact that the pandemic will have on the tax residence of companies, in view of the travel restrictions which have been imposed which do not allow board members or senior executives to travel to the company’s typical place of residence. In view of the fact that the change in location of board members or senior executives is extraordinary and temporary, this will unlikely result in any changes to the company’s tax residence status under a treaty.,A similar general conclusion is discussed for concerns relating to the residence status of individuals. Here again, it is unlikely that such a temporary change could result in a change in the tax residence of the individual as a result of applying the tie-breaker rules.,As mentioned, each case should be looked into separately depending on the specific facts and circumstances and taking into consideration any specific guidance issued by the country in question on the impact of the pandemic on tax matters."

Clearly, the unconscious bias that women don’t belong in senior level positions plays a big role. It’s imperative that organisations change the way they make hiring and promotion decisions and ensure that eligible women are given serious consideration,”,“Those making those decisions need to pause and ask, “Are we succumbing to unconscious bias? Are we automatically giving the nod to a man when there’s an equally competent woman?” And, as our data on confidence shows, there’s a need for organisations to give more encouragement to women. Leaders can assure them of their competence and encourage them to seek promotions earlier in their careers,” the study read in part.,Another research published by Catalyst found that firms with higher levels of gender diversity, and policies and practices focused on it, are linked to lower levels of absenteeism and employee turnover; higher levels of job satisfaction, engagement, and retention; enhanced corporate reputation; and increased creativity and innovation."

","On completing her secondary education three years ago, Josée Ishimwe realised that career options weren’t as easy as she perceived.,What hit her hard, the twenty three year old said, was seeing a big number of young girls being impregnated and with lack of basic needs and poverty among the contributing factors.,Adolescent pregnancies are a global problem occurring in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.,Around the world, however, adolescent pregnancies are more likely to occur in marginalised communities, commonly driven by poverty and lack of education and employment opportunities.,Also, Ishimwe said there were a big number of young graduates who were seeking jobs. These two main problems made her start thinking of how to create something of herself but also help create jobs for some of the youth to help curb the issue of unemployment.,“I knew this wasn’t going to be exceptional to me. This was a lesson that was exceptionally hard to learn, although it opened my mind on how I should start managing my expectations and also resolve the problems that could complicate my life in general,” she said., Because of this experience, Ishimwe resorted to making handmade clothes which she was passionate about but hadn’t gotten an opportunity to practice.,The second year student at university of Rwanda college of Education - Rukara Campus narrated that at her home, there was a neighbor who was making clothes from thread, she approached her to be trained on basics.,“Since I had passion for fashion, it wasn’t hard for me to learn the basics, and within a few months, I was good to go,” she said.,She started with making carpets then later upgraded to making wall frames, scuffs as well as decorating flowers.,She did this by adding the finishing touch to her products. To her surprise, people were impressed with her creativity and encouraged her to do more; the thing which motivated her to love what she was doing as well as work hard to ensure her customers are satisfied.,Being conversant with digital life, Ishimwe knew for a fact that what was needed for her business visibility was to create a social media account.,“I came up with a YouTube channel to showcase what I do. This, helped me reach out to a big audience for my business in time,” she added.,Ishimwe added that this has since improved her life in terms of being independent and when she joined campus, she had already mastered what is required and the preferences of customers.,What keeps her going however is the fact that she has helped transition this skill to other students, who have mastered it well and are as well doing it to help them cater for their needs.,“Apart from promoting Made in Rwanda, I am thrilled that my fellow students, especially girls, are becoming independent and also some even come up with something different from my initial idea just to create a business out of it,” she said.,Ishimwe said at times clients come up with ideas that they would love their products to be made or look like.

","A coalition of members of civil society organizations are set to establish a revolving fund dubbed “Community Environment Conservation Fund (CECF)” with aim to restore and conserve Sebeya River catchments and control the river floods in a sustainable way. The initiative to establish the fund is still at proposal phase. ,For several years, overflow by river has been affecting farm and off-farm businesses surrounding the river leading to huge economic losses in the districts Rubavu, Nyabihu, Rutsiro and Ngororero Districts that rely strongly on rain-fed agriculture.,Landscape restoration is underway on 18,000 hectares that are under risk of soil erosion on Sebeya River catchment with anti-erosion activities, agro-forestry, terraces, tea plantations, rainwater harvesting tanks, climate smart agriculture practices and others and at least 70 percent has been restored.,Among the highlights of the Rwf 22 billion project, part of the money will be invested in the revolving fund to ensure sustainable conservation of restored land in the catchments and thus curb floods.,A revolving fund is a fund or account that remains available to finance an organization’s continuing operations without any fiscal year limitation, because the organization replenishes the fund by repaying money used from the account.,Celestin Hitimana, The project manager at Rwanda Rural Rehabilitation Initiative (RWARRI) said that preparation of the fund is underway.,He said it is part of the development of innovative financing mechanisms and value chains for improved livelihoods through ecological and economic benefits of the people in the catchment.,“The project will establish the community environment conservation fund as an economic-empowering mechanism for communities to access credit and build a resource base to tackle poverty while restoring the land,” he said.,He explained that a management committee of the fund will be set up considering that the fund will be accessed through ‘award as loan’ for the competitive environment projects, but also, to recognize the best performers in the landscape restoration.,“The innovative financing mechanism aims to incentivize people in the catchment to both conserve the land and get economic benefits.  We will target people especially those in groups that can initiate their own bankable conservation projects at lower interest rates,” he said.,He said they will work with financial institutions close to the beneficiaries that will help in assessing and approving bankable projects.,“It has to be done through competition. The fund must continue even after the project closes and be monitored from village to district level. There will be a business advisory team to make projects bankable. It will start with 60 villages,” he noted.,The projects include those conserving water resources, smart agriculture, and forestry, green mining, among many others.,According to Joseph Gafaranga, The Secretary General of Urugaga Imbaraga Organization, which is partnering in the project implementation, there are still many challenges related to low uptake of rainwater harvesting tanks for all households and anti-erosion practices as well as illegal mining.,Government is also constructing a Rwf7.5 billion dam to curb Sebeya River floods.,The funds were mobilized by the Government of Rwanda through the Rwandan Water Resources Board in collaboration with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Netherlands Development Organization (SNV).,So far 194 saving and loan groups have been established and saved Rwf38 million , 129 households got cows for livelihoods transformation,782 households got kitchen gardens to beat malnutrition as  over 11,000 residents have secured jobs amid the Covid -19 to restore the degraded landscapes.,The groups have also saved in Ejo Heza, the long term voluntary savings scheme in Rwanda, he said.,So far, over 18,000 residents have saved over Rwf120 million in the saving scheme."

","France, known for its exquisite baguettes and cheeses, the beautiful Eiffel, and romantic Paris, has a population of over 65 million people, adding up to 0.84 per cent of the global population. This number has been slowly but steadily rising, since the 1940’s, when the population amounted to just a little over 40 million.,Africa tells a slightly different story, With 1.2 billion people living across the continent. With a population growth rate of 2.7 per cent a year, France’s 65 million people are added to its count every two years. By 2050, Africa’s population is expected to double, reaching 2.5 billion people, which will amount to more than a quarter of the global population. By that time, two in every five children will be born in Africa, and the continent will be the youngest in the world, with over 1 billion children.,The growing population and their ever-declining age presents various challenges, with food security constituting a major issue. As more people require more food, the declining median age, that is already at 19.7, the youngest in the world, means that a smaller percentage of the population will be at a productive stage of their lives, hence fewer people will be working then mouths will need to be fed.,In terms of food security, local farming plays a key role. But although 70-80% of the local population of the working age are smallholder farmers, agriculture in the region is far from being sufficient, and the continent currently spends more than $35 billion on food imports per year.,Today, agriculture is by far the most important economic sector in the continent, providing work for over 2 thirds of the population, contributing between 30 to 60 percent of GDP, and about 30 percent of the value of exports in each country.,However, arable land and land under permanent crops occupy only about 6 percent of Africa’s total land area, and the sector is far from reaching its potential, as farmers depend on rain for irrigation, heat and moisture lead to major losses of crops, and fertilizer is a far away dream. In addition, Africa has the least mechanized agricultural system in the world, with African farmers having 10 times fewer mechanized tools per farm area than farmers in other developing regions.,With billions expected to join the working-age population in the coming decade, 45% of the world’s total surface area suitable for sustainable production, and only 2% percent of renewable water resources being used, Africa has abundant resources for a massive expansion of agricultural production.,According to McKinsey, Africa could produce two to three times more cereals and grains, which would add 20 percent more cereals and grains to the current output. Similar increases could be seen in the production of horticulture crops and livestock. Just imagine the vast effects that this amount of grains, cereals, and other crops would have on the future of food security in the continent.,The African agricultural industry is by all means facing low productivity that is hindering development in multiple areas, and is compounded by climate change, a lack of technical expertise and the vast urbanization rates. For impact on the needed scale, a massive transformation of the sector is direly needed, and while existing technologies like improved seeds and fertilizers will be critical in meeting this demand, Africa’s farmers will need new, innovative practices to increase yields and get their goods to market, both locally and internationally.,Agritech, SmartAG, and Precision Agriculture are already changing the practice around the world, and are reaching Africa, where they are needed the most. Across the continent, IoT, AI, Machine Learning, and sophisticated technologies such as temperature and moisture sensors, robots, smart sensors, and drones are being used to enhance productivity and profitability.,Solar irrigation pumps are replacing costly diesel generator pumps, drones are mapping the location, size and productivity of farms, allowing farmers to quickly spot problem areas and target them with the right amount of fertilizer or pesticides, and smart sensors use light to measure soil properties and determine when irrigation is needed.,The global Agtech market was worth $13.8bn in 2020, and is expected to reach $22bn by 2025. In Africa the sector is showing immense growth, and according to Digest Africa, 131 African-based Agritech startups have raised $62m since 2018, a rise from the mere $50,000 invested in 2015. Investments in the sector are expected to rise in 2021 due to Covid-19, and the focus of global investors in food security for the region.,To tap into the vast potential that the sector holds, local governments can help by establishing a regulatory environment, adopting national digital agriculture strategies, and endorsing high-quality, skilled-based digital education, with the young generations leading the way.,Smart Agritech is the way to reach food security across Africa, and will only be relevant when accompanied by government integration, policy changes, and global investment. There are many innovative ideas out there. Let’s make them count."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/start-ecosystems-key-future,"Start-up ecosystems; the key to the future
","There is no doubt that start-ups are key ingredients for research, innovation and future economic growth. Start-ups around the world are not only contributing to economic development but are also being founded on the premise of solving society’s challenges and can therefore be critical for a community or country.,Start-ups do not and cannot exist in a vacuum. They are born in a specific context as parts of an entity – a network, a system – much bigger than themselves. Entrepreneurs are supported by a community of people, organisations and other start-ups that surround them. This is what we refer to as a start-up ecosystem.  Start-up ecosystems are springing up in all corners of the world and Rwanda, in my opinion, is very well-placed to establish itself as a leading start-up ecosystem on the continent and to attract key talent from other countries as was very well described in last week’s article by Nicky Gouder and Sarah Martin.,Of course, there is no recipe for exactly what should go into the pot when building a start-up ecosystem. However, there are a few key ingredients that each local ecosystem needs in order to thrive.,Start-ups themselves, of course, are an indispensable part of any start-up ecosystem. They determine the face of the local ecosystem and play an important role in economic growth, too. A high concentration of start-ups can also make an impact on the cities where they set up shop. Therefore, governments should be focused on incentivising start-ups as these can become critical economic determinants.,It would be hard to argue with the stance that schools provide one of the most important resources for start-up ecosystems around the world: talent.  Colleges, universities and other education institutions play a fundamental role in nurturing talent and setting the next generation of entrepreneurs and startup employees on their paths. In the age of accelerated technological development, environmental threats and tumultuous global politics, it is more important than ever before for institutions to be forward-thinking and equip their students for the challenges of the modern world. Startups will take on many of those challenges – and they will be launched by students studying at these institutions today. It is therefore critical for Rwanda’s educational institutions to have outreach programmes as well as collaborative initiatives with industry and start-ups.,If talent is the most important resource for start-ups, money is a close second. Few start-ups survive for long without an investor or a financial institution to back them – which is why they’re an essential pillar of every start-up ecosystem. Here, it is critical for financing mechanisms through the Rwanda Development Bank and for venture capital to thrive in the country as this will ensure that start-ups can continue to grow.,Incubators and accelerators are programmes that help start-ups succeed by providing them with mentorship, guidance, training, strategy, partnerships, R&D and funding. They’re instrumental in getting start-ups, especially early-stage ones, off the ground. Having access to an accelerator’s resources and network can make or break a start-up that hasn’t cemented itself within the ecosystem. Here, Rwanda already has a number of incubators and accelerators and this will be fundamental for the ecosystem to thrive.,Research organisations contribute to the start-up ecosystem in many different ways. For start-ups in industries like biotech and robotics, they can be their most important partners. But research organisations can also affect the start-up ecosystem itself by providing the insight needed to spot trends, address challenges and focus on strengths.,Start-up ecosystems are incredible talent magnets. As start-up hubs mature, they bring the best and the brightest business minds, developers, designers, investors…the list goes on. Cities benefit enormously from this influx: highly-skilled workers soon change projects, cross-pollinate organisations, and start-up up their own companies. It becomes a virtuous circle – innovation and the economy booms. It is for this reason that my colleagues highlighted the role of start-up VISAs in their article last week.,Start-ups are usually the pioneers of innovation and therefore regulation needs to provide the required support and ability for this to happen. It is therefore critical for governments to provide sound and robust regulatory frameworks that do not stifle innovation or make it hard for start-ups to operate. Regulatory sandboxes can be a key element in this regard and Rwanda already has experience in this element.,Start-ups are critical for any country and its future growth trajectory. This is even more so in a post-pandemic world and also a country tries to solve some of its key challenges. Start-ups do not happen automatically but need an ecosystem which supports their growth and allows them to thrive and flourish. Rwanda is already on the path to create an enabling environment and additional initiatives can truly transform it in a global start-up ecosystem"

High-tech industries saw an increase of 11 per cent in 2020, and cross-border M&A s rose by 54 per cent, mostly in ICT and pharmaceutical industries,” the report says.,The government of India also recorded positive growth (13%), particularly boosted by investments in the digital sector.,The report says that data on an announcement basis – on M&As, greenfield investments and project finance – provides a mixed picture on forward trends and confirms the weak outlook for 2021.,“Greenfield project announcements in 2020, 35 per cent lower than in 2019, do not bode well for new investment in industrial sectors in 2021,” the report says.,The decline in announced international project finance deals, important for investment in infrastructure, was more contained at -2 per cent, but the uptick in the last part of the year was largely concentrated in developed countries.,“These investment types are crucial for productive capacity and infrastructure development and thus for sustainable recovery prospects,” Zhan added.,The report warns that “the far more limited capacity of developing countries to roll out economic support packages to stimulate investment in infrastructure will result in an asymmetric recovery of project-finance-driven FDI.”,UNCTAD expects any increases in global FDI flows in 2021 to come not from new investment in productive assets but from cross-border M&As, especially in technology and healthcare – two industries affected differently by the pandemic.,“Although their investment activity slowed down initially in 2020, they are now set to take advantage of low interest rates and increasing market values to acquire assets in overseas markets for expansion, as well as rivals and smaller innovative companies affected by the crisis.”,European companies are set to attract more than 60 per cent of the technology deals in value terms, but several developing economies are also seeing an increase.,Consequently, South African investors plan to acquire stakes in healthcare providers across Africa and Asia. And Indian IT companies have announced a 30 per cent increase in acquisitions, targeting European and other markets for information technology services."

","As Rwanda continues to position itself as a leading financial services centre, being able to attract the right companies and more importantly, talent and knowledge, to the country is a key ingredient for the success of this industry. The recent introduction of new fiscal and corporate legislation will continue to attract foreign direct investment to the country. ,The business friendly eco-system, and the ‘open for business’ attitude of the country will also attract individuals to relocate to Rwanda, and also result in a transfer of knowledge with the local population, which will then lead to a long term and self-sustained success. Attracting start ups and their founders to Rwanda will also lead to employment opportunities, in different industries.,Rwanda can position itself as a start-up hub in Africa, and encourage growth of early-stage businesses by attracting talent from around the world. This could give the country a first mover advantage in Africa, in this space.,There are various measures governments can introduce to foster the right environment for entrepreneurship. ,It is important to understand that entrepreneurs are highly mobile, quickly moving to jurisdictions they believe offer the best mix of investment-friendly, attractive fiscal regimes and supportive legal environments. In view of this, countries need to not only compete to ensure they keep attracting foreign talent, but to also ensure they are fostering the right ecosystem for these start-ups to thrive.,A start-up is typically defined as a young company which is founded by one or more entrepreneurs to develop a unique product or service to bring to the market. Over the past decade, the global appetite for start ups has grown exponentially. Technological innovation has  brought about profound changes to organisations and entire industries. ,The so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution has ushered in various opportunities in a number of fields such as artificial intelligence, internet of things and smart manufacturing. Also important is the rise of medtech and fintech which many a times start out from academic research. The rise of technology companies, creative products and novel service offerings have made governments and individuals appreciate the role of entrepreneurial innovators.,While countries have long-standing migration channels for business purposes, they are often not best suited for individuals looking at establishing a start up business. Entrepreneurial or investor visas are often unattainable for start-up founders having early-stage, high-risk, innovative business projects, due to their stringent requirements and their emphasis on immediate economic returns, such as job creation, which can discourage risk taking.,The introduction of start up visas has grown rapidly in recent years. Countries commonly associated with a tradition of settlement such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all introduced start up visas. A number of European countries and emerging economies in Asia and South America have also launched start up visas.  ,The demand for such visas has led to a wide-range of countries to offer such initiatives and following Covid, with the rise of remote working and the already established digital nomads, the list is expected to continue growing. ,Each country has its own set of criteria and requirements for the attainment of a start up visa, which means that individuals need to carefully evaluate their personal situation to choose the country which best fits their business and personal needs. Some countries who have been offering start up visas for a substantial amount of years are now looking at enhancing their programmes and making them more competitive by introducing measures which may lead an individual in possession of such a visa to apply for permanent residence. "

Enhancing thermal comfort and refrigerated conditions for food and medicines are critical for the health, well-being, and economic development of the country,” Kabera added.,She also challenged the general public who may wish to buy brand-new cooling items to always check their energy consumption and whether they are free of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) gases.,“This is to make sure you also contribute to the protection of the environment,” she noted.,The phasing out strategy targets users of air conditioners and refrigerators from different settings including homes, offices, grocery stores, bars, hotels, supermarkets among others that can realize significant benefits of more energy-saving and eco-friendly cooling.,In 2016, Rwanda successfully led over 150 nations and states in a historic agreement that sought to avoid up to 0.5°C of global warming caused by substances that deplete the Ozone Layer by the end of the century.,The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which entered into force in 2019 is an international treaty designed to phase out such powerful climate-warming gases by more than 80 per cent in the next 30 years.,In order to implement the Kigali Amendment, Rwanda enacted the National Cooling Strategy (NCS) in 2019 with the objective of optimizing the growing needs for space conditioning and refrigeration in keeping with Rwanda’s green growth pathway.,The cooling strategy helps roll out standards for cooling technologies.,According to REMA, the country has currently reduced ozone-depleting substances by 54 per cent in an effort to fully implement the Montreal protocols by 2030.,However, the journey is still long and more efforts are needed in phasing out the substances.,Rwanda has started restricting imports of air pollutant gases used by fridges and air conditioners in the country to encourage the adoption of non-polluting cooling technologies.,An inventory that was carried out by Rwanda Environment Management Authority indicates that there are over 200,000 equipment such as fridges and air conditioners among big users of such climate warming gases."

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/public-service-navigating-disruptive-world,"Public service – navigating a disruptive world
","The Covid-19 pandemic has evolved from a major public health crisis to also a major economic and jobs crisis, the full extent of which is still unfolding. Yet, at its core, Covid-19 is just the latest in a growing list of disruptors confronting governments. They are also testimony to a global environment is becoming increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.,Tech disruptions, cyberthreats, terrorism, natural hazards – there is no doubt that disrupters abound. Massive societal change and demographic shifts, likewise, demand adaptation and preparation by governments.,While future events may not take the same shape as the pandemic, they WILL require governments to navigate profound disruptions nimbly and effectively. This short note will seek to present an overarching framework based on lessons on how our governments can navigate a continuously disrupted world.,The pandemic threatens our health, livelihood and peace of mind – our way of life. In times like this, all of the population all need public service organisations to help them stay resilient and emerge stronger.,Public services are at the forefront of the crisis. While public emergency response and recovery capabilities are strong, they are best suited for discrete events with a fixed duration. We face a very different challenge today. Public services must rapidly adjust to this new reality across three overlapping dimensions: crisis response, pandemic operations and long-term recovery. This is a balancing act in managing the now and the next, the present state and the future reality, or the new normal.,As from the very case of transmission and response from a public health authority, it was obvious that government had to deal with a number of issues concurrently and ensure that it can handle a crisis of unknown proportions and on multiple fronts. The key dimensions that one can highlight are:,• Surge response - people’s engagement with public service organisations is surging. They want to know what will happen to the vital services they interact with;,• Response governance - collaboration across an ecosystem of government agencies is at the heart of successfully keeping everyone involved in the Covid response pulling in the same direction;,• Communication & collaboration – providing trusted information about the pandemic is a lifeline for the people;,•  Economic stability - the pandemic is having a very strong effect on the global economy and governments had to intervene forcefully;,• Operational continuity - operations had to flex as numerous agencies had to deal with new requests and also accommodate the safety measures introduced which impinged on operations;,• Monitoring & response - amid all the noise and uncertainty that surrounds the pandemic, the facts will see us through,This pandemic will end. When it does, we will reflect on what we have been through – what we have lost and what we have learned. What’s heartening is that people are resilient, innovative and strong. So are public sector organisations.,I am confident that going forward, many of the capabilities we all built in in our public service organisations will be embraced as standard practice. In fact, I am confident that this experience and response to the crisis will place government agencies in a position to make rapid advancements in performance, leaving legacy technology and operations behind in favour of new capabilities adopted during the pandemic.,There are five main lessons that can be distilled, and which can be described as the five forces of change in public sector organisations:,• Flexible workforce - to keep the workforce safe, public organisations transitioned employees to remote working status during the crisis. With all the logistics and security issues addressed, there is no reason for this to disappear when the crisis ends;,• Break the silos - building on the networks formed during the crisis, public sectors need to continue working more closely across ministries and agencies;,• Embrace digital - the crisis has shown that public services need to be digital to the core to build additional resilience. More work needs to be done to deepen digitalization and to ensure that the mentality is truly digital and seamless. This will bring benefits to all;,• Secure supply chains - supply chains had to be assessed and strengthened. In the future, public sector organisations will continue to adopt new sourcing and data models so that supply chains are flexible and secure;,• The role of AI - AI-powered technology is helping agencies process information quickly and accurately right now. Automation and AI will become more desirable for maintaining service levels. The future will see greater adoption of AI across public organisations. With it will come new roles, new governance and new public service delivery models.,The future environment remains highly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Different shocks will ask from our organisations a response, not necessarily as that necessitated by the pandemic, but we will still have to rise up to the challenge.,Governments will need enhanced capabilities in three areas to help navigate both current uncertainties and tomorrow’s even more uncertain world,Identifying forces and events that could place unprecedented demands on governments and their mission but could also create new opportunities for governments. Foresight abilities generally focus on two themes – understanding trends and uncertainties and analysing scenarios. The key is to use foresight as a mechanism to build organizational bias toward action rather than paralysis in the face of uncertainty.,Adjusting quickly to changes affecting customers, operations and the broader ecosystem. Agility requires organizational characteristics that allow resources, data and staffing to flow and adapt as needed. This means, becoming an adaptable organization, driven by fast, flexible decision-making that learns and adapts constantly.,Withstanding and recovering from disruptions. Investing in resilience can help organisations structure their processes, resources and systems to better withstand future disruptions, so that performance will remain relatively unaffected or “bounce back” quickly.,The Covid pandemic will be a turning point for us all, and for everyone we serve as leaders of the public service. This is a challenge to which we have all rose and confronted. This is a time to build and adapt our organisations so they can weather the most unexpected events and disruptors because public service will always remain at the forefront of any crisis.,What is required is a cultural shift, one that recognises that success requires the ability to anticipate, adapt to, and withstand disruptive events. Leaders should embrace these capabilities for the organization while developing their own skills in foresight, agility and resilience."

The resulting textile is known as felt or boiled wool.,The reason behind the intervention Dufitumukiza explained, is to ensure women are kept employed. Also, there is a need for the organization to conserve and value this kind of art done by hands (natural).,“Identifying and fostering creativity is crucial for continued economic growth and social change not only in Rwanda but Africa in general. Apart from the business perspective and creating jobs, the mental aspect also comes in,” he added.,They recruit vulnerable women from the community, they range from widows, young mothers, HIV positive patients to those from poor backgrounds.,With their members’ vulnerability exposing them to trauma, the organization offers trauma counseling to the beneficiaries by providing psycho education and individual counseling.,If it wasn’t for Handspun Hope Organization, the women attested that they wouldn’t have become the open minded people they are today.,For instance, the organization has helped them embrace the changes that come their way. One such example, they said is using their big number to come up with their own grocery shop as a group, which they plan to start soon.,From 120 members, each will contribute Rwf 50,000 of which at the moment each has so far contributed Rwf 10,000.,The main purpose is to have a store of their own to buy what they want to from, instead of buying elsewhere, and share dividends amongst themselves.,Donatinne Muteteri, a mother of one narrated that joining the organization three years ago has helped her overcome a miserable life she went through as a child growing up without parents.,Apart from her child being in school and catered for in terms of medical insurance, she has also bought a cow from her savings, which has helped in improving her living standards in general.,Jacqueline Mukayuhi, another beneficiary attested that she has managed to invest in farming where she has been renting farms and planting Irish potatoes.,The profit from this, she is planning to buy her own land to continue with the farming activities.,The organization commenced with ten beneficiaries but now has 117, working on a permanent basis.,They have 360 merino sheep they rear for wool.,The organization has so far built homes for 16 beneficiaries, and plans to do the same to others. Accountancy and saving are other skills women benefit from.,The members are also encouraged to take their kids to school, with the aim of trying to break the cycle of poverty as they believe empowerment, chiefly through vulnerable women, is a central principle for reducing poverty and improving the health and wellbeing of children and communities. ,“Equipping, educating and employing are key facets in helping individuals find sustainable solutions to poverty,” said Dufitumukiza."

","With a month and a half under its belt, 2021 has already brought along some monumental events. The USA inaugurated its first woman vice president, Elon Musk became the richest man in the world, Facebook and Twitter banned Donald Trump, and Covid vaccines began rolling out. But the most surprising, and some would even argue, most significant event of 2021 to date, is the stepping down of Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO. Earlier this month, Bezos announced he will be leaving his post later this year, and will be replaced by Andy Jassy, currently the CEO of Amazon’s cloud Web Services. Bezos will still be present in the company, transitioning to executive chairman of the board.,This marks the end of an era. Bezos launched Amazon from his garage back in 1994, naming it “Amazon” because it was “exotic and different”. The online store began by selling books, and within two months sales were up to $20,000 a week. The company’s soaring success led to its IPO that took place in 1997, at $18 per share. Today the share price is $3277.,Bezos was a trailblazer of new ideas and concepts, single handedly leading his garage-born company to becoming a global success story in only a couple of years. On the path to success, he also established the fundamentals for online retail, with innovative thinking leading every step of the way.,Since the launch of Amazon, innovation and creativity became leading pillars in the business and tech world, and today they are not only important for company growth, but for actual survival. In our ever-changing world, where companies rise and fall on a daily basis, managers can learn a lot from the mighty giant that is Amazon, and its thought-leading, soon-to-be former CEO.,Bezos began his career on Wall Street, and quit to start Amazon, in the very (very) early days of e-commerce. After the fast profits of his online bookstore,  he began his customer-centric thinking, and sent out an email to a 1000 random customers asking ‘‘Besides the things we sell today, what would you like to see us sell?’”. The answers he received were all pretty lengthy, but they all had one thing in common: they all wanted Amazon to sell whatever it was they were looking for at that exact moment, with one customer asking for windshield wiper blades, and another for plastic cups for a party (sustainability was not as essential).,“I thought to myself, ‘We can sell anything this way,’” Bezos said at an Economic Club of Washington talk back in 2018. And thus, began the crazy journey of Amazon, with Bezos maintaining an innovative, thought provoking approach, as the company continued growing. Amazon is responsible for some of the most --- practices in retail today, with the customer-centric approach leading the way. From powerful recommendation algorithms that tell us what to purchase, through customer ratings that reveal preferred products, to the fact that anyone can open a virtual storefront from their own garage, anywhere in the world.,Alongside its innovative practices, the company is also a pioneer in fostering a culture of innovation for its millions (!!) of employees, with ways and practices that could lead other business owners in inserting innovation to their ventures.,According to the company’s employees, or “Amazonians”, innovation takes place as a part of everyday work. As the company’s customer-centric approach leads every step of operations, there are a few key ways that employees use;,A passion for invention is a key factor in everyday proceedings, and employees are encouraged to think outside of the box in order to come up with new ways to provide the best services for their customers. This is encouraged through the PR/FAQ document (Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions); The employee outlines their vision for a new product through a theoretical press release, and writes a FAQ that explains the customer benefits and answers potential customer questions. Then, a fellow team evaluates the idea, leading some to, initial funding, development, market deployment. Amazon Go, Prime, and Alexa were launched through PR/FAQs.,The company’s long-term vision and focus is another important factor, and to that end, Amazon has never paid its shareholders a dividend, but instead invests all the profits into existing products and bold new bets. This reality encourages employees to always stay on their feet in terms of new products, and also fosters failure as an option, and even a somewhat positive outcome of their boldness. As long as it’s ok to fail, people are not afraid to suggest the craziest, most out-of-the-box inventions.,Another important factor is the “two-pizza rule” stating that every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The goal wasn’t to cut back on catering expenses, but to encourage a sense of responsibility and entrepreneurship, while saving time on managing timetables.,These practices are some of the reasons why Amazon went from $511,000 in revenues in 1995, to $386.064bn, a 37.62% increase from 2019. “Today, we employ 1.3 million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world”, Bezos wrote in his goodbye letter to employees earlier this month. “How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We’ve done crazy things together, and then made them normal…Keep inventing, and don’t despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1”.,In 1995, Amazon had one million products for sale, and they were all books. Now there are more than 350 million products, — and over 2000 of those products are windshield wiper blades. If that’s no innovation at its finest, I don’t know what is."

from waste
","Noel Nizeyimana is the Chief Executive of Greencare Rwanda ltd, a company he co-founded with three other young entrepreneurs (Francis Mizinduko, Christian Ruzindana, and Jean Paul Iyakaremye), after graduating at University of Rwanda in 2015. ,The entrepreneurs use waste especially plastics and sachets that they heat and mix with sand to make bricks and pavers.,This has enabled them to offer employment opportunities to a number of Rwandans, yet keeping the environment clean.,Although they had different expertise in soil and environment management, civil engineering and crops science, they were committed to reshape the waste management in Rwanda by converting existing systems of solid waste management “landfilling” into industrial recycling plants. ,The company was officially registered in 2016 and licensed in 2017 by Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and Rwanda Utility and Regulations Authority (RURA) respectively. ,While dealing with urban agriculture, and solid waste management issues as part of their undergraduate program in Soil and Environment Management and Civil Engineering, the four business partners saw that the waste management situation in Huye city, where their campus was located, was not well managed. ,According to Nizeyimana, the waste collection services were poorly organized; the small quantity of waste collected was disposed of in unhygienic ways.,For instance, the waste was piled up mostly in the streets and in unmanaged landfill sites, creating several serious health and social threats, including diseases, insufferable odour, leakage of pollutants into water sources, methane gas, and exposing the waste-collectors to toxic and hazardous substances, he said. ,In collaboration with Huye District, the entrepreneurs worked together to discover a sustainable solution for solid waste management by organizing waste collectors and transforming all waste generated at Huye recycling plants. ,“75 per cent of waste received at the facility is biodegradable waste, which has been converted into packaged organic compost branded ‘Grekompost’ by using a windrow composting system and 20 per cent is plastics and sachets,” Nizeyimana stated.,The co-founders transform ecological pavers and bricks by mixing appropriate ratio of plastics to sand under a desired temperature. ,Today they have a production capacity of 400 tons of compost per year and 2,560 meters squared of ecological pavers per year. They have employed 25 permanent young men and women working in compost and ecological pavers production.,The entrepreneurs also work with five agro dealers companies that distribute GreKompost to the farmers across the country.,Just like any business, challenges are inevitable. Among their day to day challenges include insufficient skills and knowledge on the best technology for solid waste management. ,“Lack of stakeholder’s inclusivity for solid waste management implementation, lack of a proprietary model or policy for funding and financing solid waste management projects is still a problem,” Nizeyimana emphasised.,The young businessmen also claim that there is a shortage of policies regarding integrated solid waste management, for example, currently solid waste management system used is waste collection, transportation and landfilling.,This system, they say, leads to waste resources by dumping the waste; the waste produces toxic gases, and contaminated underground water by heavy metals. Landfilling areas reduce the land available for agriculture and are a breeding ground for bacteria which can cause many diseases to the communities surrounding the facility for example, Nduba landfill in Kigali. ,The entrepreneurs also lack clear policy regarding manufactured organic fertilizers use due to the low number of industries engaged in compost production at industrial scale, thus leading to the lack of market, subsidies and distribution channel.,They highlighted that manufactured organic fertilizers need to be regularized as well as chemical fertilizers in order to promote organic fertilizers and Made in Rwanda.,The businessmen are calling upon the government to adopt integrated solid waste management in different districts, for instance, waste generation, collection, and waste treatment through Reduce, Reuse, Recycle system.  ,They are also urging the government to develop policies and regulations regarding integrated solid waste management from waste generation to waste treatment. "

Some recovery was noted in the second half of the year with the completion of several deals,” Ashley Schoombee is quoted saying in the report.,Consequently, the slowdown effect on the pandemic was evident in the volumes and values of non-local corporate, sovereign and supranational debt raised during the year.,Like it has been in the past four years, the initial public offering (IPO) activity continued a downward trend.,According to the report, a total of five IPOs were recorded in 2020, the lowest number in a decade.,In 2019, the volume of IPO activity recorded a decline of 47 per cent compared to 2018.,PwC points out that the largest IPO in 2020 by value was the dual listing of Bytes Technology Group on the LSE and JSE, raising $467-million.,Bytes is a UK business that demerged from South African technology company Altron.,In contrast however, further offer (FO) value in 2020 increased by 16% compared to 2019, but fewer companies accessed the market in 2020, which continues the trend of lower FO volumes over the past few years, PwC states.,The report highlighted that domestic deals accounted for 71 per cent of ECM volume and value recorded in 2020.,This has been the same trend for the past couple of years.,Statistically, domestic activity accounted for 72% and 78% of ECM volume and value, respectively. There was a significant decline in outbound ECM activity between 2019 and 2020.,In addition, PwC reports that African issuers have raised $167-billion in non-local currency debt from 536 issuances over the past five years.,“Patterns of corporate non-local currency bond issuances have been somewhat inconsistent over the past five years, owing to the small number of active issuers and the variable size of issuances over the period. Total proceeds in 2020 represented a five-year high of $7.2-billion.” The report reads in part.,“A state of uncertainty seems to have become the ‘new normal’ globally, and we can expect some degree of volatility and caution to continue to affect Africa’s capital markets activity in 2021,” Andrew Del Boccio, PwC Africa Capital Markets Leader, said in a previous interview with the press.,Egypt has consistently been the largest issuer of sovereign bonds over the past five years, accounting for 38% of all sovereign bonds issued in 2020.,In 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, many countries cancelled or postponed their plans to issue bonds in light of the pandemic related economic and financial uncertainties."

This new updated Kigali Master Plan 2050 is an upgrade to the 2013 version and will lead the economic and social growth of Kigali for the next 30 years.,Considered as a densely populated city, Kigali is projected to have 3.8 million inhabitants by 2050, increasing from the current 1.6 million with a rapid increase in the number of elderly people and the worsening issue of young people unable to afford to leave home, will drive demand for multi-generational accommodation. More homes will be designed with flexible layouts to suit different generations, which can be adapted as families’ needs change.,Homes of the future in Kigali will increasingly tap into neighborhood energy systems, feature flexible layouts and use improved technology to make automatic decisions about heating, security and even postal deliveries,,More innovation will be used when designing “third age” homes for people over 65, reflecting demand for accommodation with lifts, level access and communal activities, whilst retaining privacy and a sense of ownership.,By 2050, technology will transform homes into collectors and storers of energy, with electricity, now generated by non-fossil fuel, most likely to be used to heat homes and hot water.  ,Electric cars will be commonplace with every property equipped with a charging point. The future home will manage its energy use from a centralized platform, combining heating, electrical consumption, ventilation and vehicle charging.,As energy efficiency becomes ever more important, ideas currently used in workplaces will become standard in homes, such as allowing non-essential equipment to automatically power down when electricity is at peak price.,Urban planning that combines adequate housing with quality, inclusive and sustainable neighborhoods. This calls for public officials who are most sensitive to the everyday needs of Kigali inhabitants should be committed to planning mixed, compact and polycentric cities where housing benefits from a balanced context and contributes to the social, economic and environmental sustainability of the urban fabric.,And also, promote the compactness of urban fabrics to combat urban sprawl.

Some of these schemes include:,Share Options – the company would grant the option to employees to acquire shares at a future date, for a pre-determined value;,Share Awards – the company would grant shares to the employees once specific and predetermined targets are met;,Phantom Shares – the company grants the employees with the benefits of shares, without actually transferring or allotting shares to them.,Through share option plans a company would grant employees with an option to acquire shares in the company, or in an associated company, for a fixed, pre-determined price. The options could vest over a number of years, depending on the time the employee has been employed with the company.,The granting of the option is, typically, not a taxable transaction, however once the employee exercises the option, this could be deemed to be a fringe benefit and taxable accordingly.,Phantom Share Plans are being more commonly used nowadays to provide benefits to,employees, without the possible complications of having them as shareholders.,Phantom share plans are plans where the employee does not receive actual shares and does not become a shareholder of the company, but he/ she is entitled to the dividend as an actual shareholder. Every time a dividend is paid, the phantom shareholder will be entitled to a cash payment, typically in the form of a bonus, on a pro rata basis depending on the number of phantom shares held.,The value of the Phantom Shares will fluctuate with the company’s share value, and the,employee will be as invested in ensuring the company continues to grow and become profitable, as an actual shareholder,Irrespective of which share scheme, or combination of, a company chooses to implement, getting the company valuation right is essential in ensuring that employees receive their shares, or options, at a price which is fair to them, given their past performance but more importantly, the expected growth of the company.,It is important to strike the right balance between providing employees with the possibility to acquire shares in the company lower than market prices, whilst at the same time ensuring that the price is fair when one takes into consideration the efforts, money and sweat equity which the original shareholders put into the company.,In most situations, such as in the case of share options, employees are given the right to acquire shares at a future date, sometimes even the option to acquire shares in tranches over a number of years.

Each of us tried to take some of their savings obtained from different casual works they do when they are not at school and invested in the initiative. We hope that the initiative is a preparation of green jobs in the future for both students and vulnerable communities,” he said.,He said that the tree nursery plantation on land availed by the school has started to create green jobs for women and youth around the campus.,“There are two permanent employees who help us look after the tree nursery and when there is a lot of work, at least ten people get casual work where each gets a wage of Rwf2, 000 per day,” he said.,The nursery includes orange, mango and citron fruit trees.,“Some will be given to vulnerable families for free while members of the public can also buy these fruits trees. If someone needs over 1,000 seedlings, we can sell them at Rwf1, 000 per seedling but for those who need fewer seedlings, they can buy one seedling at Rwf2, 000,” he noted.,He said that once planted the trees, vulnerable families could generate income from them.,“After one and half years, one mango tree can provide income of over Rw50, 000 per month during two harvesting seasons. These could help eliminate malnutrition but also help generate income. They can plant trees in gardens which will also green the city,” he said.,He said the trees will green the school and some communities in the city.,The plastics used in raising the seedlings, he said, are also recycled in Agroplast Ltd, the company which recycles plastic waste into different materials in Kigali city.,Faida Zoubeda Uwase, a deputy co-founding member said that seven members of the body are female showing the passion of girls in environment conservation and job creation while still at school.,“If families manage to plant fruits in their home gardens that will reduce cost on expensive fruits they buy on the market.  We will also set up environment clubs to help educate people,” she said.,It is also a platform to help us to put into practice what we study at university. With that as students, we want to show our impact on the community, fight mitigate climate change and create opportunities in the sector,” she added.,In a campaign to fight malnutrition especially among children, the government seeks to ensure that every household will have to plant at least three fruit trees in partnership with different stakeholders.,According to the latest Demographic and Health Survey released by National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda, the percentage of stunted children under the age of five dropped from 38 per cent to 33 per cent in the last five years.,Joint efforts could reduce it from the current 33 per cent to the projected 19 per cent in 2024 which requires moving from 1.2 per cent reduction per year to 3 per cent reduction."

","As Mobile Money increasingly becomes popular locally and across the world, fraud cases have been on the rise.,As of 2019 there were 481 million registered mobile money accounts in Africa, making up 46 per cent of global accounts, with more people turning to using mobile wallets instead of cash, as a safer option.,The number of international and African players entering and expand into new markets across the continent providing user-friendly alternative to processing micro-payments and reduce the amount of cash people need to carry with them.,However, with the progress, cyber security experts say have also seen an increase of multiple forms of fraud.,Bethwel Opil, a Manager at Kaspersky in Africa said that threat actors are constantly coming up with more innovative tactics to compromise people’s wallets whether these pertain to traditional bank accounts or mobile wallets,“While there is ample benefit to be gained from mobile money, spam, phishing, social engineering, and fraud all form part of the cyber-attack landscape when it comes to this innovation. Threat actors are constantly coming up with more innovative tactics to compromise people’s wallets whether these pertain to traditional bank accounts or mobile wallets,” Opil said.,The firm noted that telcos and other service providers have to maintain standards and procedures that will curb vulnerability as well as improve consumer education.,“Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. And like all other digital solutions, this is often the end user. Education is therefore the most critical component of mitigating the risk of social engineering compromises from people opening malicious links, sharing sensitive information, or falling foul of fraudulent schemes,” Opil said.,Among ways clients can reduce vulnerability include avoiding having a device being compromised by refraining from clicking on malicious emails, attachments, or other messages., “Users must look out for red flags in communication from those purporting to be from service providers. For example, they need to be wary of grammatical mistakes, attempts to incite a sense of urgency or danger, e-mail addresses and links that differ from the official ones (even if just by one letter), and so on,” Kaspersky officials advice.,“Never trust messages unconditionally. It is imperative to check any potential issues through one’s personal account on the Website or in the mobile money app. This is especially important when it comes to messages confirming the crediting of funds,” they added.,Users are also urged to avoid using unfamiliar delivery service especially with regard to online purchases.,“It goes without saying that users must never give out personal information beyond what is necessary for the transaction. This includes usernames and passwords,” experts further said.,“In many respects, it is still the ‘Wild West’ when it comes to mobile money and e-wallets. Even though the solutions are safely used by millions of people daily, hackers are always on the lookout for soft targets. Constant vigilance and education remain essential to safeguard against any potential compromises,” Opil said.,MTN Rwanda, in 2020 saw their active mobile money user base grow from 2.8 Million to 3.2m while Momo pay users had increased from about 200,000 to about 1.4m.,However, with the increased uptake and usage ,, there has been an increase of fraud which the firm said is constantly working to curb including awareness campaigns."

Rwanda
","Mukande, a 31-year-old woman from a remote village in Gisagara District is sweeping the ground outside her home while talking to one of Ignite’s on-field agents. Her husband is out in the field, working on their maize crops.,Her 11-year-old son is standing close by, next to one of the family’s cows, while her younger daughters are running around the yard. “Having light in our home completely changed our lives”, she exclaims. “The kids can now do their homework after dark, and I can cook whenever I want to”.,Mukande and her family have had access to solar-based electricity in their home for the past year. “Now with the lights, we sleep much better. We used to sleep with the cows before, because it wasn’t safe to leave them outside due to the many thefts going on after dark. Now, thanks to the light we keep them outside, and everybody has more room to sleep comfortably,”Mukande points out “,Mukande’s story is a depiction of millions across Africa, who have been connected to electricity in recent years through off-grid solar solutions., During the final months of 2020, Ignite’s employees canvased various villages across Rwanda’s rural communities, gathering some meaningful testimonials about life before, and after gaining access to power. And the changes are undoubtedly monumental.,Across the continent, the number of people gaining access to electricity doubled from 9 million a year between 2000 and 2013 to 20 million people between 2014 and 2019, with Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Rwanda playing the main role in the revolution. In Rwanda, the access rate rose from 9.7 per cent in 2010 over 34 per cent in 2020, to almost 85 per cent in 2019. As numbers of connections per year grew, so did the role of solar off-grid systems, reaching more than 25% by 2019.,But alongside vast improvements and development, Africa’s population growth rate is outpacing the rate of electricity connections, and Covid-19 is already affecting electrification efforts, as global and local budgets are directed to fighting the pandemic. While billions of dollars go to vaccination efforts, and other pandemic-related, necessary affairs, it is important to remember that unlike other countries that can put all their efforts into the Covid fight, Africa has other crucial needs that must be addressed. Electricity access is a leading necessity, vastly influential on multiple elements of everyday lives, and leading to ample development across the continent.,“Before having light we used petrol and risked burning the house”, says Celestine, 45, who lives with her husband and their 2 children in a village in the Gisagara district. “Now we feel much safer.”,Throughout the rural areas of Sub Saharan Africa, petrol and other combustible fuels are used for lighting, cooking, and heating purposes, which are often done through indoor open fires. The fire and smoke contribute to high mortality and disease rates, as homes can be easily burnt to the ground, and smoke causes various diseases including pneumonia, lung cancer. Across the region about 1 million mortalities a year are caused by smoke-related health issues.,The problem is not only in the household. About 730 million tons of biomass are burned for fuel each year in developing countries, releasing as much as 1 billion tons CO2 into the atmosphere. In addition open fires emit high concentrations of a number of black carbon and methane, both with significant climate consequences.,Having home electricity also provides various opportunities for increasing household income. “Before having lights, we used to bring maize to clean, and had to finish before nightfall, and now we can continue after dark.” Mukande explains.,“Before having the solar system we used to sell 30 kg of maize, now we are selling 60”.,Across the SSA, over 52% of the working population is in the agriculture field. But albeit a source of employment for over half of the continent’s population, the sector contributes only 23% of the GDP, due to poor irrigation, rotting crops, and insufficient national funding. This contributes to food insecurity which is a major concern for the continent, even more so now during the Covid period. To that end, upping crop sales by 50% is that more meaningful.,Education has been a sore spot for people all over the world since Covid began. In the western hemisphere, millions of children have been studying from home, via different online platforms. But across remote communities in the SSA region, such platforms are not really an option. School closures in the region sent around 250 million children home, and learning completely stopped for most of them, with many likely to never return to class. Having home electricity is meaningful for the long term, as it may enable access to online schooling. But even the light alone makes a meaningful difference. “Before we had light, the children didn’t have time to do their homework. They were at school until 5:30pm and then did house chores,” says Nyirarukundo, 43 from Kivomo.,“Now kids are studying and getting good grades at school”. And it is not just the kids that put in more effort into their education. “My 27 year old son is studying! And showing interest! His sister, 15 years old, is also doing much better in school. Their knowledge increased”, Mukamparaye, 57, from Kivomo exclaimed excitedly.,Despite the immense progress throughout the past decade, more than 600 million people across Africa are still living without electricity access, and these numbers are expected to increase due to population growth and the Covid pandemic. For us who take electricity and its various effects for granted, it is crucial to take a look at some of these testimonials, portraying the change that electricity has, on the smallest, and largest scales. As we redefine global priorities during these turbulent times, it is important to remember that basic infrastructure such as running water and electricity play an essential role in human development, and should not be left behind."

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/business/mission-oriented-post-covid-transformation,"Mission-oriented post-Covid transformation
","Although Rwanda was growing at a fast pace and transforming itself into a beacon of excellence for the continent, the pandemic will definitely leave a set of scars behind. The crisis we are experiencing has a triple face: a grave economic situation, accompanied by an increasingly urgent climate catastrophe, and exacerbated by a health emergency.,Our recovery must therefore have the direction of inclusive smart growth: more innovation, more well-being and more sustainability. This is essential to rethinking the direction of growth and also the way in which public and private interact, in order to ensure a long-term sustainable path. The objectives of sustainability and inclusion must cut across this entire transformation and must emerge from a process of consultation and discussion with institutional actors, but above all with citizens and social movements. This “bottom-up” approach allows challenges to be defined in such a way that they speak to the lives of citizens.,This transformative process requires a new approach to policy-making which is referred to as a mission-oriented approach. Missions are tools for transformations aimed at solving crucial social, environmental and technological challenges, by means of a concrete process, characterised by achievable targets, and involving as many sectors as possible; public institutions, social organisations and above all citizens, thus putting the person and the community at the centre of the economy.,This philosophy means that we should start looking beyond GDP as the yardstick for development and the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are aimed to provide such a direction and to also highlight the economic, social and environmental challenges on a global scale.,Tackling and solving these challenges requires a fundamental change from traditional industrial policies. It is crucial to move from a logic centred on a list of sectors to be supported, towards a better and more complete identification of problems whose solutions require multiple sectors and actors to finance and develop processes of innovation and transformation.,The idea behind missions is not to start by asking which sectors or technologies should be helped, but rather which problems need to be solved. The key is to think about problems in the most ambitious way possible, involving various economic actors in the solution (public, private and non-profit) and establishing new forms of collaboration at the level of individual projects. Much of the discussion around missions can be conceptualised in terms of major challenges, which in the case of the United Nations are represented by the 17 SDGs. Transforming these challenges into concrete missions is the first step.,Missions should be cross-cutting in terms of sectors and actors involved in the process. In this sense, a “vertical” mission on a theme can have a cross-cutting impact on different economic and social areas. The dynamics are both top-down, in terms of directionality of the challenge and the identification of the mission, and bottom-up, with the activation of projects that involve multiple actors and solve the everyday problems of citizens.,The success of missions requires the fulfilment of a series of conditions, which must be embedded in the process before and during their execution.,First, they need to be bold, inspirational and with social relevance. The missions must be able to inspire the actors involved and have a broad relevance for society. They must be able to connect with the challenges of sustainable development to have an impact on a significant part of the population.,Secondly, missions require citizen involvement. For their definition, implementation and evaluation, missions require citizen participation in public debate. They must also be shared by a healthy number of institutional and social actors, so that they can also be pursued through different political cycles.,Third, they need to be targeted, measurable and time-bound. The missions must have a precise direction. They must be focused, measurable (with tools that capture the overall qualitative impact) and bound by a time limit.,Fourth, missions need to be backed by public sector capacity. Missions require the development of skills and entrepreneurial spirit by the state. Public actors must conceive of themselves as elements of a system that creates and shapes markets and technologies. Among the capacities that the state must assume there are: the search for coordination between different structures that operate by departmental silos; greater flexibility and autonomy of some departments, agencies or other public organisations; a positive approach to risk, linked to learning processes; the possibility of setting a strategic use of public procurement on the entire industrial and social apparatus.,Fifth, ambitious but realistic. The missions must be ambitious in order to motivate the actors involved, but sufficiently realistic to be achieved. The financing of projects, by public and private parties, must be adequate and follow the needs for the realisation of the mission, without constraining its definition with strictly fixed limits or a short-term return perspective.,Finally, cross-cutting and bottom-up. The potential of the missions is maximised by the activation of multiple initiatives between different sectors, actors and disciplines. Several projects contribute to the realisation of missions, as well as to their possible redefinition, through constraints and opportunities that may bubble up during their implementation.,The mission approach presented here provides a lens through which to rethink economic and industrial policy. It is an innovative way to collaborate across sectors inspired by the great challenges we face. It must involve different actors, from the institutional arena to the business world, from universities to the third sector."

It was initially scheduled to take place from February 21-28 but was postponed to contain the spread of Covid-19.,Mugisha has not been on good terms with his club since winning the Grand Prix Chantal Biya in November last year after he was denied a move out of the club to end long-standing feuds with his coach Adrien Niyonshuti.,While SACA refused to release Mugisha and instead left him out of the squad training for the Tour du Rwanda as disputes remain unsolved, the rider told , that he no longer sees himself playing under a coach who, he says, has been treating him badly adding that he prefers to miss out on this year’s Tour du Rwanda until his contract expires in September.,“How can I play under a coach who beats me? I can’t work with someone with whom I have disputes. I requested the club to let me go but I was threatened that I have nowhere else to go,” claims Mugisha.,“I can’t continue doing my job in such conditions. Of course, I am unlikely to increase my points if I don’t participate in this year’s Tour du Rwanda edition but there are still chances in future editions,” he added.,Mugisha’s relationship with his coach Niyonshuti has been strained since July last year when the duo was involved in a training bust-up.,Although he is regarded as one of the favorites to win this year’s Tour du Rwanda, the rider was left out of the team preparing for Tour du Rwanda 2021 and is not able to train on his own after he was requested by SACA to return cycling equipment.,Niyonshuti recently told the media that, despite recent impressive performance at Grand Prix Chantal Biya, the young rider’s lack of discipline could ruin his cycling career if he does not make the profession a priority.,The tactician said he would be happy to see Mugisha back in the group and focus together on winning the Tour du Rwanda.,“Mugisha is a good player but he needs someone to advise him to help him give his career a good direction. He is not part of the group currently training for Tour du Rwanda as long as his issue is not sorted yet but if he is ready to rejoin the team to prepare for Tour du Rwanda, I would love to see him back,” Niyonshuti said.,Mugisha wanted to part ways with SACA but the club didn’t want to, prompting the rider to submit a complaint to Rwanda Cycling Federation (FERWACY) in February but he claims his request fell on deaf ears.,“I submitted the complaint by email at the beginning of February but I haven’t got any feedback,” he said.,However, FERWACY President Abdallah Murenzi, told this publication that the federation has done everything possible to end the feud between Mugisha and his club but no solution has been secured yet.,“We spoke to SKOL’s boss Ivan [Wulfaert], the player and his coach to see if the case can be solved amicably but in vain. We are still trying to play our role as a mediator but if it doesn’t materialize, then they can go to court,” Murenzi said. ,“The federation has nothing to do with what the club and the player agreed in the contract and we feel a competent court can better intervene,” he added."

","With the Covid-19 pandemic and measures to curb it, many across the city are spending more time at home. This has led some to seek ways to improve their homes to make them more appealing.,Two young female graduates, Allen Ingabire and Paulette Mpano, driven by their passion for nature have found a business opportunity therein in interior and home décor.,It all started with their love for plants; how they transform spaces and their versatile capacity to act as herbs and medicine.,This, they say was fascinating to them and through research, they came to understand that this could be developed into a business. They ultimately saw potential in this field after discerning that it was a few people who had ventured into this type of business.,The more they talked to people about this idea, the more they were pushed and motivated to go for it. That’s how Ivy Bliss Murugo was born.,Their idea was to invest in something that would allow people to explore the beauty of nature in their homes and offices. They also desired to contribute towards the fight against climate change.,For three years now, the young entrepreneurs have had their focus on landscaping, indoor and outdoor decorations, where they sell potted plants, do gardening, designing and advisory in this field.,Their products are made through a combination of different materials from different vendors to come up with finished designs.,“To elaborate on this, we work with potters who make the pots, nursery owners to get plants and what we do is come up with an Ivy Bliss potted plant, or buy plants somewhere and plant them in someone’s garden,” they say.,When it was all still an idea, Ingabire, (the founder) had a conversation with the CEO and co-founder of Akilah institute, Elizabeth Dearborn Hughes, about what she was going to do in the future since she had just graduated (from Akilah), as she recalls.,“I explained to her the idea of starting a plant business in Kigali. Two months after the conversation, Elizabeth challenged me to provide 70 potted plants to all Akilah staff.  It was a huge first order and we were not prepared. We did not see it coming but we accepted the challenge. We had pots made, searched for plants and everything else that goes into a well finished product and delivered as agreed.”,And though, there are so many things they did not understand about plants, running a business and working with different vendors, their project ended up being a success, they say, adding that the money they made from this project became their capital and that it has been a fun journey since then.,They have since learnt a lot from the job. For example, they now understand that to be a great designer, one needs passion coupled with constant learning.,“This industry evolves a lot and it requires someone to really be on the lookout for what’s trending. We don’t call ourselves great designers or landscapers but we hope that one day we will be. What we most love about our job is the satisfaction that comes with doing what we love and seeing the expected results come to reality,” the girls share.,Even though they say they don’t have full time employees, they delight in the ability to create occasional opportunities for talented potters, plant nursery owners, carpenters, and gardeners. That makes them feel like they are contributing to their community.,“We also love that our business gives opportunities to our clients to explore what more they can do in their homes and offices that was not there in the last few years. To us, plants give a new life to any place. They grow, heal, bring peace and warmth into our homes which can inspire how we live daily. On top of that, we live in an era where people spend more time at home especially with the Covid-19 outbreak. People want something that keeps their mind busy outside of work, something that is relaxing and brings satisfaction.”,The feedback they have been getting since the first lockdown is the satisfaction and serenity that the plants offer; watering them and seeing them grow day by day- people embark on a journey with them and grow together.,When making or choosing designs, the duo says they look at what is durable, attractive to the eye and matches the space they are working with. This is how they mostly find what designs, plants or pots they use on a particular house/project.,“Usually, it depends on the space we are working on, whether it’s outdoors or indoors. We also consider clients’ preferences, along with many other factors. We then come up with tailored proposals, sometimes we work with clients who don’t know what exactly they want; for them we share proposals and try to sketch for them so that they envision what the finished product will look like.”,They have learnt that many clients are not familiar with knowledge about plants, for example they don’t know what plants go inside, what needs full sunlight, what doesn’t like water, or what you can’t have when you have babies around because of toxicity. That’s why they give all the required advice to clients before they embark on any project.,In Rwanda, indoor plants are the new thing and they stand out because they bring life and beauty into spaces, the girls say.,They also noticed that that the trend of hanging plants on walls or wood boards has been picking up lately.,“Not so long ago, people only planted plants in gardens and no one thought that some could be hung on walls, or placed on wood boards or even bring them inside. I think all these great innovations are coming and they give us an opportunity to help people have them in their homes.”,So far, their business has been a success with clear optimism for their business to grow and become the leading and go-to-plant guru for Rwanda and other countries.,Nonetheless, their journey hasn’t been without hiccups. For them, it was the constant fear that they will fail or that nobody was going to buy their product or service. They however trusted their guts and hopped on this journey.,The other challenge is; they are both full time employees at other companies which makes it a little challenging to fully concentrate on this business.,“Also, some people in Rwanda do not comprehend our business and it could be a challenge to penetrate the market. There is a limitation of what plants are available in the region. That makes it hard to provide different plants to different clients.”,On the other hand, their cash flow currently only allows them to work with occasional employees which sometimes is a challenge when they have big or urgent orders.,They nevertheless look to the future with hope to expand their line of business.,“One of the businesses we have started working on is gifting. We started with a pilot phase by creating gift hampers during the festive season and we received positive feedback. We intend to share more about ourselves and what we do so we can continue growing in this market.”"

I went on to play college basketball at Northeastern Junior College, then transferred to Grambling State University (Louisiana, USA) where I graduated.,I have always loved watching basketball. But I started really playing basketball in high school. Before that I thought I was going to be a football player. I also ran track and was getting college interest. (200M hurdles and High Jump) It wasn’t until my freshman year when I grew to be 6’4 I knew I really wanted to pursue basketball.,My rookie year (2019-2020) coming out of college I played for Apoel; a team in Cyprus and competed in the FIBA Europe cup. Unfortunately, the head coach who signed me left and so did I. I joined KB Trepca a team in Kosovo for the remainder of the year.,Of course this is around the same time the world started getting affected from this pandemic so my year ended early as leagues got cancelled.,My biggest games were played at Grambling State. A school not very known for winning before I got there. My recruiting class came in and played a huge part changing the culture.,We got the longest winning streak in the country for any D1 school at one point and competed against some of the best teams in the country like Iowa who have produced many NBA players. ,I grabbed 21 points and 6 rebounds against notable high major schools such as Georgia Tech who also have current NBA players from that team. Every stage feels big for me. I want to compete at the highest level I can in every game.,Other than college, Afrobasket to me feels like one of the big stages because I am representing a whole country.  ,It was my first call-up. I felt honored to be called to represent my country. At first, I didn’t know what to fully expect but I was really excited.,My career goal is to be the best possible version of myself. You never know where this game will take you or what team you will end up on, so I just want to be the best possible basketball player I can be while helping my team win.,Having started playing basketball late in my life I know I got a lot of room to grow. Also, another goal/dream since I started playing was to play in the NBA.,The experience I gained is priceless. Like I said it’s a blessing to be able to represent Rwanda in these tournaments. I can say fans should expect some highlight plays, a hard-working player, as well as a high level of competitiveness."

It is a partnership between the NBA and FIBA. For the first time the NBA is entering in this type of endeavor, launching a professional league outside of North America.,I think that speaks to the opportunity and tremendous potential growth of the sport of basketball in Africa and that is the reason why we opened our office in 2010, and I think all the work that we have been doing even before opening the office because we launched basketball Africa Camp in 2003 at the grassroots level.,Many of these countries have national leagues and the BAL is like a champions league model where champions from different countries qualify to participate in this unique league that is designed to really grow the entire ecosystem of basketball, to create an industry to use basketball as an economic growth engine.,And when I am here in Kigali looking at this arena where we are, you can just imagine all the business activities that could flow around having an infrastructure like this.,Our initial plan was really to play in 7 different countries. So, we were going to launch on March 13th in Dakar. As I said we have 12 teams, we divided the 12 teams in two conferences, and we were going to play a weekend tournament.,Like we were going to start in Dakar with 6 teams and then the following weekend we were going to take the other 6 teams to Monastir in Tunisia, and then the subsequent weekend we would go into Luanda, then to Lagos, Cairo, Rabat; and we would have completed the initial stage called the regular season and then the top 8 teams were going to qualify for the elite 8 that we were going to host here in Kigali end of May.,So obviously Covid-19 has forced us to change our plans and since we postponed in March, we were just monitoring the global situation with the pandemic and also how it evolved in Africa to try to figure out what is the best date to launch this historic league.,So as the pandemic kind of subsided, we were looking to launching the league before the end of 2020 with a modified format.,Rather than playing in 7 countries, we were going to just play in one location. So , , to have all the 12 teams here just like similar to what is happening now with these qualifiers (Afrobasket), but obviously the situation for us has not evolved enough not to present any risk for us and this is why we are deciding to wait until 2021; and it really had nothing to do with the Covid-19 situation on the continent and especially in Rwanda.,The government of Rwanda, RBC (Rwanda Biomedical Center) and the Ministry of Health have done a fantastic job managing the pandemic.,But the issue was how do we get our immense logistics here in the country because we were looking to put up a big show, something that really has never been done before.,We were extremely excited and our partners - the Rwandan government, RDB, the Ministry of Sports and FIBA were very ready, but we all collectively decided that let’s wait to give ourselves a better chance for maximum success, to launch the league in a way that we think it really deserves to be launched.,So we are working with all our partners and stakeholders to look at what is the best next opportunity in terms of windows in 2021. What I can tell you is that it is going to be launched within the first semester of 2021, it means before June.,We will continue to work with all our teams and FIBA and our host country to decide on what that date is going to be and I hope that very soon it is a date that we are going to be able to announce. It will be announced well ahead of time and that is what we are working on.,Being here obviously gives me a chance to connect with FIBA and all the national teams that are here.,Most of the countries taking part in the Afrobasket qualifiers, I believe, with the exception of maybe South Sudan, they have teams that will be playing in the BAL and I guess 40 percent of the players on these national teams will be playing for clubs in the BAL, so it is just super exciting to be in an arena and watching basketball for the first time in close to a year.,And just watching what is happening here in terms of the level of organization is very inspiring and gives me even more confidence for the opportunity we have in 2021 to do something special.,No, it is the same 12 teams that have qualified for this inaugural season that are going to also participate in the inaugural season launch. It is still our inaugural season that we are looking to launch. So, the 12 teams that qualified, they will be the same teams competing.,Well, we always talk about women and talent, you know, at the NBA we have the WNBA that is over 20 years old where women showcase their world class athletes.,You get global superstars that are brand names like Maya Moore, Lisa Leslie; and from Africa: Chiney and Nneka Ogwumike from Nigeria……. These are ladies we work with who are a big part of our effort to grow the sport across the continent and you many have heard that the NBA has launched the NBA Academy Africa in 2016.,We have a girls’ academy where we bring girls from multiple countries periodically throughout the course of the year for weeks of seminars and a camp, and a number of them actually have obtained college scholarships in the USA.,Since we opened the NBA Africa office in 2010 in Johannesburg, our main priority was to increase participation in the sport, and we cannot do that by ignoring more than half the population.,Basketball is a game that women play at an equally high level as men, and I know throughout my travel and involvement in basketball on the continent that the women’s game is more popular in certain countries than the men. I remember Mozambique always had incredible teams, in Senegal our women’s basketball team is iconic.,I was saying this a couple of months ago, I remember growing up, some of the names of some of those ladies that you listen to on the radio winning multiple championships then, and they were also students.,And this is something that always resonated with me, and for us it is an extra effort that we have to make, but it is just going to be a natural progression. Obviously we have to start somewhere – we are starting with the men’s league but I have no doubt that we will be talking about the women's league for the BAL.,But for now let’s get to the next step, toss the ball and have the inaugural season."

","I was driven by impact. We have been holding this programme for over two years at the Champions Karate Academy. Then in June 2019, I had the opportunity to attend the 59th International Session for young participants at the International Olympic Academy in Greece where I learned about the IOC Young Leaders Programme.,While in Greece, I learned a lot and was inspired to even take my karate training with children to another level; that is how the ‘,’ programme came up. It is also in line with the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3) – good health and well-being for all. Thankfully, I also secured financial support from the International Olympic Committee to implement the project.,We decided to put the training in holidays because during off-school period, children are often wasting time watching television, or on video games, a concern that is shared by parents. They wanted a place where their children can be safe but at the same time be occupied with something that would benefit them.,Besides karate – which is the main sport, the youngsters also take part in badminton, basketball and chanbara sports.,Karata was chosen as our flagship sport for many reasons. Firstly; I am a karateka with Black Belt 3rd Dan, so I understood and its core principles than any other sport. Secondly, I am a long-time member of the Champions Karate Academy, so it was easy to secure venue for training. Thirdly, I wanted a sport that is less demanding and needs minimum equipment.,When you have uniform and a place to train from, that is enough to practice karate.,Lastly, and the most important reason, karate has great ability to teach discipline and values than most sports, and that is what I wanted the children to take from karate.,Our main funders are the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Panasonic and the Yunus Sports Hub who are the mentors of the IOC Young Leaders in implementation of our projects.,But since the project is aimed at making impact at community level, obviously we also needed the involvement of local partners and they did not disappoint. I thank the Ministry of Sports for availing space at the national stadium for us whenever we asked for it, and our development partner – the National Olympic Committee – who gave us an educator for Olympic Values to speak to the trainees.,And then, the Rwanda Karate Federation as a development agency of the martial art in the country, they provided us with coaches and top athletes to inspire children during training.,The project has really been a joy to watch and see the kids we started with growing and earning promotion in belts (promoted in grades). We also received positive feedback from parents on behavioural change; both at school and at home.,Most parents agree on two key things about the impact of our training; their children are now able to focus and accomplish the tasks they have been given to do at home and at school, and have gained self-confidence that allows them to express themselves in public.,Some of our young karatekas took part at this year’s Karate Ambassador Cup in February for the first time, and that is encouraging because they could be karate champions of the country in future.,A year since the project was launched, I think the Champions Karate Academy has been equipped with the tools and knowledge that will continue to be used to educate children and work with the IOC Young Leaders programme in future projects.,I won’t dwell much on what didn’t work because we have achieved so much to be happy about, but maybe I will mention just two challenges: Covid-19 disrupted some phases of our training programme, and the lack of enough local partners so more kids could participate.,Only this year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, we were able to work with 229 children – including 75 girls – between the ages of 4 and 16.,It is also my wish that the Holidays Karate for Children Programme can be permanent, and what is needed is just partners to work with and make it sustainable, and also the active involvement of parents."

","BEHIND JASMINE KIBATEGA’S win and bubbly character is an incredible and inspirational story about her musical journey.,Seven years ago, Kibatega was a karaoke performer in various bars across Kigali, but today, the 26-year-old , a music contest that concluded last week at Kigali Arena.,Those who know the hurdles of performing in bars can easily understand that Kibatega’s journey has never been easy from the very beginning. In fact, if not for her love and passion for music, she could have quit the trade a long time ago.,Kibatega shared that singing karaoke started shortly after she completed high school back in 2014 but, for a girl her age, kicking off a music career in bars is always challenging and she was no exception.,“I had to control myself because I had a vision, I had a dream and, from there, I always thought that singing in bars…it’s for my exposure. I am exposing myself so that maybe any opportunity could come about. It was challenging, but I am grateful because I am here now,” she added.,Her love for music came about when Kibatega was at a tender age. She would always dance whenever a song was playing in the background. Her passion and inspiration for becoming a musician, however, started when high school friends admired her voice when she sang for a schoolmate on her birthday.,“One of my friends had a birthday and was like ‘sing for us’… then I started singing. Everybody was blown away and was like, “You have a beautiful voice,” recalls Kibatega.,“And I started to build the passion and love for music from then till this day. I started developing that love, that passion, and that was the only thing I could do,” she added.,Before introducing herself to music, especially karaoke, Kibatega informed her mother of the idea as she sought advice for her next course of action.,“I was like ‘mum, I really want to be a singer, I really want to follow a career as a singer. And she was saying, ‘Are you sure? How about school?’ you know how parents can be sometimes (laughs). But she was right!” the singer recalls.,“It was not hard (to convince her) because we have a strong connection. She’s everything to me, she’s my friend, and she is always there for me. Every time I wanted to do something, she was like, ""Go for it, get your own experience, and, from there, I will help you decide if you carry on or do something else. So for that, I am grateful to have her, it’s incredible, she is amazing,” she said of her mother.  ,Despite the passion and trying to help everyone at bars have fun, Kibatega decided to quit performing karaoke in bars in 2018 as she was only earning peanuts. However, in 2019, she reconsidered and kicked off from where she left off after realizing that her life belonged to music.,“I remember, most of the time, I wasn’t even paid. It was tough but I’ve learned a lot from it, grown so much from it, and… look at me now!” she excitedly said.,Her journey of singing in bars came to an end in 2020 when Kibatega heard of ‘The Next Popstar’ music contest and after winning the contest, the singer has no plans of looking behind.,“It’s now over. That was a lesson, an experience, but I want to write another chapter in my music,” she said.,Kibatega had no idea that ‘The Next Popstar’ was going to happen until a friend encouraged her to take part in the music contest. However, she hesitated.,“From the very beginning, I didn’t believe in ‘The Next Popstar’ because I didn’t think that in Rwanda we had that kind of talent competition happening. But she kept pushing me to audition for it,” she recalls.,She enrolled among over a thousand aspirants who registered to contest and she came out the winner of the contest, overcoming stiff competition from rapper Ish Kevin and four other finalists.,Upon winning the contest, Kibatega walked away with a whopping Rwf10 million cash prize, while the rest of the money will be spent on the production of her songs at either local or foreign music studios.,The singer described the journey to winning the music contest as ‘so difficult’ but with her mother’s presence, she was always ready to make her proud.,“Every time that they had to pick some people from a certain round, it was always a privilege for me because it built me up even stronger, more confident, and even believing in myself,” she said.,“My mum and my best friend, Peter, were around, and to be surrounded by that kind of love and support made me feel like I was going to win,” she added.,For the singer, winning the contest has opened room for her to write a new chapter in music by building a new career and doing her own music.,“To be honest, I am grateful for the past, but I feel like God has leveled me up to the extent that I can’t go down again. That’s an experience, a part of my past, and a part of who I am because it’s a part of who I am now. This is a new beginning, and I am ready for a new challenge,” she said.,Apart from recording a number of music projects under the support of her sponsors, the singer revealed that she already has some projects in the pipeline as she looks forward to using ‘The Next Popstar’ platform to build her career and name as an artist.,Kibatega gets inspiration from Whitney Houston, and the love she has for the American singer made her perform the majority of her songs during the music contest."

Gospel music is home to so many talents but which lack support and empowerment and hence do good music but with lower production standards and quality. That keeps gospel music lagging behind and some are left with no choice but to switch to secular music which looks more dominant,” Nyandwi said in an interview.,“They have all it takes to thrive but, still, they lack support and empowerment.

I have loved music since I was young, although I was not able to do my own music so I started from Karaoke in bars. Whoever has followed me during my journey, don’t ever give up on your dream no matter what people say,” she said.,She dedicated the prize to all her supporters but, most importantly, her mother.,“I want to thank you before the public. I am thankful that you were so patient, even where I did wrong, and for the support you gave me. We did it,” she exclaimed.,She also urged parents to support their children in their talents so they can realize their dreams.,Kibatega won the contest after two rounds. The first saw Yannick Gashiramanga and Honorine Irakoze Hirwa eliminated before she progressed to the grand finale as the lone female alongside Gisa cy’Inganzo, Ish Kevin and Jackson Cyiza.,Her performance in the second round earned her a vote of confidence from three-judge panel that comprised of Lion Imanzi, singer Aline Gahongayire and Producer Jay P whose accumulated points saw her win the inaugural edition of the contest.,Kibatega and Ish Kevin who emerged first runner-up will travel to the United States in June for a two-week visit during which they will be given detailed information about the contract they will sign with the contest sponsors.

","AFTER FINALISING its post-production project in December last year, ‘Trees of Peace’, a feature movie that tells a story about four women who survived the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, is finally here. The film will start showing during an online premiere from April 9-10, during the commemoration week., ‘Trees of Peace’ is the story of four women who find unity, hope, and strength through one of the world’s darkest tragedies.,Based on events during the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, four women from different backgrounds and beliefs are trapped together in an underground room., As they contend with the fear of being found and fight a slow death from starvation, they are forced to reconcile their inner demons and put their differences aside to live through the day—for 81 days straight., American filmmaker Alanna Brown, the movie director and producer has announced that the 97-minute movie will for the first time premiere next month,  during the 27th commemoration week of Kwibuka 27.,“I think it's amazing that the film will premiere during the Commemoration of the Genocide against the Tutsi. Rwandans (and all audiences) can expect to see an intimate story of four women; it is not so much a tale of the Genocide as it is of these women living through it. I hope to make Rwandans proud of this representation on screen,” Alanna told The New Times in an interview. , “I made this film to honor the women of Rwanda, who I see as inspirational and as warriors. It's incredible to me that Rwanda has the highest percentage of women appointed to government of any country in the world and I want that fact to be more widely known. I want audiences to see Rwanda as a global example of progress after great tragedy,” she added., The project was conceived about eight years ago when Alanna was interviewing a woman who founded an initiative to help rebuild women survivors in Rwanda and the stories inspired her.,She began writing the screenplay in 2012. It was a two-year process writing the initial script, which was soon noticed by agents and managers., She then spent a couple of years meeting with studios, producers, and executives that loved the script but found the film too difficult to make., “During this time, I financed, produced, and directed a proof-of-concept trailer to hopefully attract financing,” said Alanna in an interview., Soon after that, Alanna ran a kickstarter crowd funding campaign to raise funds to make the film on a micro-budget., The campaign, she said, was successful, and then she began fielding offers from small production companies and producers to try to get the film made for a larger budget., These avenues didn't progress to anything, so in 2019 I decided to go forth with making the film with the fundraising money and I planned a trip to Rwanda., Around that time, producer Ron Ray reached out to her on Kickstarter after seeing a sample of her other work. But he wanted to see more of her work, and upon seeing the proof-of-concept trailer and the script, he agreed to produce the film.,  Within four months he secured equity financing from private investors and the film went into pre-production., The film was shot in October-November of 2019 but the post-production was delayed and extended due to Covid-19. It took all of 2020 to be finalised. , The film stars four main characters namely Annick, Mutesi, Jeanette and Peyton and each, according to Alanna, is a warrior in her own right but has demons that she struggles with, touching on our vast duality as humans and as women., The lead characters include Charmaine Bingwa, Ella Cannon, Bola Koleosho, Tongayi Chirisa and Rwanda’s famous actress Eliane Umuhire, who plays the lead role of Annick in the movie.  , Because the movie was shot in Los Angeles, United States, Umuhire flew to the United States for the production., “We filed and paid for her visa to work in the U.S. and flew her out to Los Angeles for the production, which was made for a small budget despite the extra financing I got. My credit on the movie is writer/director and I was also a producer,” the filmmaker spoke of Umuhire.,Alanna hopes to screen the movie in Rwanda, at the Rwandan film festival, given the pandemic permits., “If it can't screen at that time, I would hope to work with Eric (Kabera) to secure a screening date and time in Kigali for a public audience,” Alanna said., The film has so far only been screened at Santa Barbara International (listed by Studio Bilm finder as one of the top 10 festivals in the U.S.), the world premiere and the very first screening., “Hopefully we will screen at more [festivals) to come,” she said.  "

","BENOIT IMENA is a proficient and unrivaled artist who would make you believe that without art, the world would be a boring place to be. ,In addition to painting, realistic pencil drawing and design, the 19-year-old’s other craft is in making paper guns that are used in movies.,With his left hand, he sketches out anything his mind lands on, for instance; people, landscape, walls, nature or anything his clients want, and with a mixture of diverse colors, the outcome is amazing. ,Imena’s love for making guns started at a tender age. He was passionate about toy guns that his parents gifted him with some on special occasions. Like any inquisitive child, he sought means of how such guns are made. He checked out YouTube tutorials and before long, he had started making guns out of cardboards.,Some of his ‘guns’ have been used in local movies such as; “Killerman series”, “Major series”, “Pattyno comedy” and “Mistustu na boss” and featured in a music video titled, “Game Zanjye” by Fizzo Mason, among others in production. ,The youngster shared that it takes him about two to three days to complete one gun, depending on the type and size and each of his guns goes for Rwf 15,000. When it comes to painting, some portraits take him about two days and others such as landscapes, about four days to perfect. This is because they are complicated and require more creativity. ,He also recalls starting to draw as early as the age of 10. ,One time while in Primary level, a teacher asked students in his class to draw a car, but was mesmerized at what Imena had drawn. It was so perfect that he was awarded with a prize. ,In 2017 he sold his first artwork and that pushed him to do better. It was also the same year that he attended a school competition where he made an AKA-47 paper gun that left people turning heads in awe of his talent that he won the competition. ,On joining Ecole d’art De Nyundo, he was exposed to real art as he learned new techniques that helped him polish his talent. He was equipped with skills in drawing, painting, decorating, design and so forth. ,He has so far started to enjoy the fruits of his work. He earns money out of it and he has grown his network too.   ,According to the artist, it’s those little steps that keep him moving forward. He is anticipating that his talent will be recognized not only in Rwanda but also beyond. ,He wants to be among the artists that are invited to attend different art exhibitions and he is looking forward to building an art gallery to showcase all his artwork and teach youngsters talented in art how to draw and paint.,Imena also wishes to work with promoters to not only promote his art but also other Rwandan artists’ locally and internationally, not underestimating the power of social media as well. But rather use it to share the immense Rwandan talents., “My wish is to see that my guns are used in many movies and music videos in and outside Rwanda and I am optimistic that this will come to pass,” he says. ,Besides the costly materials, Imena says that some of them are not easily accessed. But also, he was dismayed that he doesn’t have any art galleries to display his artwork yet. "

It was actually one one of my biggest motivations because I refused to give up and I didn’t want to let people think that I am a failure.,I asked myself why I involved myself in this competition. I almost gave up but then I thought ‘No, it’s Ok, be patient and don’t react.’ ‘Maybe it’s time to test your patience’.,I love kids so much and I always wish to do the best I can to ensure they are happy.

His love for music started at a young age, often mimicking people singing on radio or television most of the time and while in primary three, he wrote his first song inspired by Biblical scriptures. That was when he was sure he was born to sing. ,Today, the 35-year-old church a minister, who is devoted to singing for God as a way to serve Him and win many souls to Him. He has three audio albums to his name namely; “Kunesha Bidasubirwaho” that contains 12 songs, “Kumarwa Ishavu” that consists of 10 songs and “Amajwi Y’inyoni that has 10 songs, all accessible on his YouTube channel, Phanuel Bigirimana Official.,With challenges faced in his music, he cannot afford to shoot videos for his songs because they are very expensive.  However, he is certain that this will not evade his dream of being an international gospel artiste.,The gospel minister believes that for his dream to come true he will have to record songs in both English and French as most of his released songs are in Kinyarwanda. This way, his songs will have a wider audience and bigger reach, since his fans and supporters are mostly Rwandan.  ,Earning from Gospel music and its challenges,Bigirimana says that gospel music is partly lagging behind because of the belief that the artistes should sing for free. He believes however that even though spreading God’s word is free, with music it is different because without money, there is no way gospel music can be produced or developed.,He also carries on that the issue of copyright isn’t respected in Rwanda as people consume and share music without permission. His wish is to see all musicians earn from their efforts and investements."

It is their biggest source of revenue. Miss Rwanda is 100 per cent private and it only generates revenue from sponsors and the public. There is a lot that goes into the organisation,”,“As you might be aware, this year the public is not allowed to attend the grand finale, so there won't be any gate collections. This is just a source of income.

Nimwiza said that $3 is not too much to ask, considering that the cheapest ticket used to be Rwf10, 000 to access the venue.,The 20 contestants in the Miss Rwanda 2021 final remain in the boot camp at La Palisse Nyamata, where they are undergoing skills training as well as confidence boosting classes ahead of the Saturday finale.,The finale will take place at Intare Conference Arena, Rusororo, this Saturday, March 20, beginning at 7pm. ,The winner will drive home a brand-new Hyundai Creta 2021 series, a scholarship, a fully funded project and a salary of Rwf800,000, along with other perks.

They are really lazy. They release one song in a year but I release hit songs every now and then. You cannot find any similarity between me and those guys,” Bruce Melodie says in the audio, which has since attracted a lot of criticism from fellow singers and players in the industry.,Bruce Melodie made the comments at the backdrop of releasing his latest song “Bado”, whose official video was released on March 13. Whether it was a gimmick to promote his latest song or not, he has surely ruffled feathers in the music industry.,Tom Close is among those who have come out to openly criticize Bruce Melodie for disrespecting fellow artistes, who have been in the music industry longer than he has. He said that however much Bruce Melodie can hit, he cannot overtake Meddy.,He said that while it is true that Bruce Melodie is a good singer, being arrogant can be counterproductive, especially if he disrespects fellow artistes.,“You can do 200 songs and someone else does just two songs and hit more than yours. It's not about the number of songs but rather, the quality of the songs,” Tom Close said, pointing out that Meddy, for example, has a song that has reached over 30 million views.,He added that you would have to combine all Bruce Melodies songs to surpass Meddy’s YouTube record for a single song.,Meddy’s “Slowly” has so far been watched by over 45 million people on the video streaming platform.,Veteran former Family Squad member, Spax, who has been missing in action in recent years, also got out of his music hiatus to criticize Bruce Melodie, accusing him of ‘growing wings’.,“I normally don’t get on camera to show my face and speak about issues but I just came out to remind Bruce Melodie that he should not be too comfortable to forget where he has come from,”,“Meddy and The Ben took Rwandan music to the world. Their efforts shouldn’t be disrespected. It is time Bruce Melodie started looking outside his small circle that praises him and focus beyond that. Meddy and The Ben have attained international status,” Spax, who now lives abroad, said.,The comments have triggered a number of social media reactions, with some pointing out that Bruce Melodie is indeed hardworking compared to his peers. The “Saa Moya” star has been relentlessly releasing music in recent years, easily turning himself into the leading Rwandan artiste locally.,Ramadan Mupenda, the founder and proprietor of local music label, The Mane Records, also weighed in on the issues, saying that he finds no problem with what Bruce Melodie said because it is ‘his time’.,“It is true Bruce Melodie is doing great at the moment. You cannot deny that. His work speaks for itself. He also has the right to say what he said. We have to respect his opinion,”,“However, we need to have an industry where the role of legends or those who came before are treated with respect because of what they have achieved,” Mupenda, also known as Bad Rama, said.,He said that for example, even though one of ‘The Mane’ artistes Marina is doing well, she cannot claim to have surpassed Knowless Butera, who was already established way before Marina could start singing.,Faded rapper Lil G, also chipped in, perhaps, in a more brutal manner, stating that Bruce Melodie used to ‘mop halls’ where the likes of Meddy, The Ben and himself performed before he could make a breakthrough.,As such, Lil G, real name Lionel Karangwa, thinks Bruce Melodie should calm down and focus on work rather than disrespecting his peers.,Surprisingly, in an interview last week, Bruce Melodie had heaped praise on Meddy particularly for taking Rwandan music to another level, only for him to contradict himself in the leaked audio.,Both Meddy and The Ben are yet to openly comment on the issue.,Efforts to get a comment from Bruce Melodie and his team were futile.

","Last week, two internationally renowned muralists, namely American Benjamin Swatez and Canadian Azerine Amanda De Luca completed a week-long painting exercise of two large-scale murals, with traditional decorative patterns framing either side of the front entrance of Rwanda Arts Museum in Kanombe.,The mural, which they painted alongside nationally recognized local paint artists Samuel Ishimwe Daddy and Louise Kanyange, was completed on Thursday, March 11, after four days and three hours working on it.,National values such as unity, integrity, cultural and economic growth, and self-empowerment are conveyed through the composition that transcends time from pre-colonialism to aspiring dreams of the nation.,The mural was, according to Swatez, painted after a series of brainstorming conversations with the museum management about the theme that they were going to paint to help people passing by be able to interpret the message (on the wall paint) based on the colors and symbols.,“There was an initial conversation about the Genocide and what emerged from that experience,” Swatez told ,Swatez explained that the mural gives a glimpse into the core values, ethics, and integrity of Rwandan culture while it also takes the audience through the pre-colonialism, the history, the pride, the integrity, hard work, expansion and the vision of the country in different periods of history.,“We looked into all of these times in the timeline of Rwanda, the tough lessons, beautiful things that ever happened as well, and everything that has transpired from pre-colonialism to right now and the future,” he said.,“From the other side, from the reconciliation, forward, what are the dreams, what are the hopes, the reactions and what are the efforts of each generation to come and can somebody be born 30 years from now and look at that wall and be able to reconnect with it? It was talking about ancestry, and also new vision and the actions to create that development,” he added.,Swatez and Amanda have traveled the world sharing the power of creative therapy as a form of psychosocial support and jointly painted large-scale murals in 37 countries as part of their (just-concluded) project ‘Heart of Resilience’, teaching art and painting murals down the entire Congo River.,They painted similar murals in Kenya, Tanzania and DR Congo.,Before painting the murals, the duo would talk to the communities and gather information about what inspires them to get the right context of a mural they would be able to enjoy once they pass by the mural and have experience of the message it carries.,“I think the beautiful part is the people and their reaction style. Some were like ‘oh cool!’ and others were like ‘what is that?’ but, at the end, everybody really enjoyed it and were really inspired,” Amanda spoke of her experience in DR Congo.,“We’ve learnt so much about Rwandan history, about the current time and the future that everybody dreams or aspires to get to, and that’s how we figured out the composition,” she said.,During the mural painting exercise, Swatez and Amanda were joined by local painters Samuel Ishimwe Daddy, also known as Daddyism, and female painter Louise Kanyange, with whom they spent four days and three hours working on the mural. ,Besides the experience and doing arts as passion, Ishimwe said the week-long collaboration helped him learn from the muralists that art is more of passion than money as long as he is doing art for society., “With them, I have realised that sometimes you have to do art for people because the things we do are for selling and, in society, there are many people who can't afford those kinds of paintings but they need art in their lives, too,” Ishimwe said.,Ishimwe is positive about the murals on the street where anyone who will just pass by will see the message on the mural.,“You can pass by, take five minutes, go through the art and talk to that piece (of wall painting) and even if you’re sad, you will go home happy without paying,” he explained.,A similar mural had previously been painted at the Rwanda Ethnographic Museum located in Huye District, Southern Province, while the initiative could soon reach more museums across the country as part of adding momentum to a rising street art culture that adds to the quality of life for all citizens.,According to Robert Masozera, the Director-General of Rwanda Culture Heritage Academy, the wall painting outreach programme will be extended to six remaining museums.,“These mural paintings draw inspiration from the history and cultural heritage of Rwanda and we still have other six museums, we always have the strategy of what we want to take to each of them. Rwanda is not only attracting tourists but also becoming a country of creative arts where artists come and are inspired,” Masozera said."

poet’s drive
","22-year-old Gretta Ingabire uses poetry to assure herself of the immense things she has to accomplish. To her, poetry is a way to express what is on her mind, convey messages that are aimed to teach, inspire and entertain.,She mostly likes writing about society, to speak about social changes that all human beings can embrace for a better world. But also, creating a voice for changes in women’s wellbeing, such as equality and control over their own lives. ,Ingabire started writing poems at the age of 12 while in high school. She started by writing in her diary on a daily basis, and somehow, stories started flowing., One day, her school hosted a guest-speaker who encouraged students to write—the kind of writing of ‘speaking without telling people whatever you think or imagine, or experience’.,Ingabire didn’t know what the guest-speaker meant but she gave it a shot anyway.  She practiced it almost every day, and was fascinated. With time, she learned about poems and writing as a therapy, and everything it adds to a person.,She has lost count of the number of poems she has written. Some of these include “For us”, “Like it’s not enough”, “Dear heroine, teach us”, “I want Freedom”, “Stubborn women”, among others, which are all on her YouTube channel (Ingabire Gretta) and other social media platforms. ,“My journey in poetry has taught me a lot about myself first, what I’m capable of and what I can achieve. It is, however, challenging because it’s still an industry that has a long way to go, but I believe it’s just a matter of time,” she says.,Ingabire is also a visual artist. She started drawing a bit early, around primary five or six. As a gesture of affection, she offered her drawings as birthday gifts to her friends, a thing she enjoyed doing and gave her gratitude in return.,Now as an expressionist painter, she did a course in art in high school at Ecole d’art de Nyundo. There, her talent was enhanced. While drawing, she uses paints, brushes, pallet knives, and so many other things that help her create something nice and unique. ,“Just like writing, the art industry still needs a boost for people to give it value and understand it. It should be a lucrative industry, as it is in developed countries,” she notes., Ingabire says that effort is still needed in spreading arts awareness and its impact on society.,She hopes that with time, quality art materials will be easily available in Rwanda, and more local platforms for poets will be accessible, so that spoken word poetry is live on different stages.,Among her achievements, Ingabire graced the International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa-ICASA in 2019. ,In July 2019, she organised a solo art exhibition titled “Spoken Art” at the Innovation Village Gallery in Kacyiru at the public library. This went on for two weeks and was attended by a number of people. This, she says, was one of her greatest experiences.,The show was the second female solo exhibition in Rwanda. Ingabire was impressed with the whole setup, and that she had to showcase most of her art pieces and their copy prints for those that couldn’t afford the original paintings.,According to Ingabire, the journey of practicing art is one that sometimes stresses as she feels like giving up, but because of her passion for it, she keeps going.,“This is a journey of connecting with different people, some that encourage me, while others dishearten me in diverse ways. But there is something I have learnt so far which is, if being an artist is all that I want and is all that burns in me; then I will just keep falling and bouncing back, it’s all I have got,” she says.,Her paintings can be accessed at Envision Art Gallery and range from $200 to $500."

magic touch
","He is one of the most outstanding videographers in Rwanda, with his name etched on most modern Rwandan music videos you can think of, alongside Bernard Bagenzi.,But Meddy Saleh cuts such a humble figure, you wouldn’t think he is the same person behind some of the most popular music videos we watch on a daily basis.,From the way he speaks to his meek demeanor, Meddy Saleh is the epitome of people who can be described as ‘calm and collected’.,One would imagine that his works, which have earned him celebrity status, have made him inaccessible, given his schedule, since he is one of the most sought-after videographers in Rwanda but from the look of things, the 41-year-old has not let it get to his head.,What is more fascinating about this is that he actually did not do any courses in videography -it is all in the love for video as a form of art.,“It is something I used to like since I was a child. I even used to lie that I'm sick so that I don't go to school so that we can stay home watching movies and stuff like that,” says Saleh in an interview with ,.,“I learned by myself. When I went to Tanzania, I met a friend who was from Burundi. He was living in Tanzania and he was filming at weddings and from there, I started to like videography,” Saleh recalls.,The filmmaker who was born in Gahini, Eastern Province, lived his life between Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Tanzania.,He spent his childhood studying in Goma, DRC during the day and returning to Gisenyi, where he lived in the evening. In 1994, his family moved to Kinshasa for three years, but later his mother moved to Tanzania and he also relocated to join her.,He returned to Rwanda in 2002 and met Eric Kabera, the organiser of Rwanda Film Festival and founder of Rwanda Cinema Centre. Kabera saw him show a friend something he shot in Tanzania, and it caught his eye.,“When he came into the cybercafe and he saw what I did, he just told me to come and so we could talk and see if we could do something together,” he recalls.,For Meddy Saleh, videography is something you need to do as a passion if you want to do it well. It is much more than setting up a camera and shooting. One has to use their artistic skills to be successful at it.,""First of all, it has to be a passion. You have to love what you do. Sometimes people think that videography is all about knowing how to shoot, take a picture and you just get money,” says Saleh.,For him, it wasn’t even about the money. In fact, when he started off, he worked for free in cases where artistes he worked with didn’t have the money. He fell in love with the idea of art, and he would propose to work on their projects for free.,He also continued to improve his skills by watching what other professionals in the craft do on YouTube. His big break came in 2005 when he was selected to take part in the Maisha Film Festival in Uganda, a videographer or short film producer.,It was during the seminars at Maisha that he met the now globally famous Lupita Nyong’o and did a short film for her. Although she was yet to hit the big screen at the time. When he looks back, he thinks that was his biggest project.,His other big projects include film documentaries for the African Development Bank (AfDB) and for Transform Africa Summit, among others.,Despite making a name as one of the biggest photographers, the journey has not been without any challenges.,“Sometimes people don't understand what we do and they think it's an easy job to do. They don't understand that we spend time filming, we spend time editing, we spend nights,” Saleh says, adding that it is for the same reason people don’t understand the value of what they do.,“I don’t think people give the real value of what we do,” Saleh says, adding, however, that the perception is improving because people now no longer go to South Africa or Kenya when they have big projects, as was the case before.,When it comes to working with artistes, Saleh says most times he has to come up with the whole idea or concept. If he is lucky, an artiste will come up with an idea and all he will need is to add value, but mostly he starts from scratch.,He enjoys working with artistes who are creative and can come up with ideas because it makes his work easier.,When an artiste comes with a storyline or storyboard, he will use a shorter time to get it done as opposed to when he has to improvise. He however believes that the future of videography in Rwanda is bright.,“The future is bright because for now there are many videographers and they're doing well,” Saleh observed, ably saying that currently, Rwanda ranks better among East African countries.,The filmmaker believes that if Rwandan videographers got the support they need from the government and the media, they would do even better and be recognised beyond Rwanda.,Saleh also said that the work of videographers directly promotes the image of the country, citing Tanzania as one of the countries where videographers are established and as a result their industry has grown.,Like many industries, Saleh said the visual industry, which is still growing, was hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak.,“In the beginning, it was not easy, but now we have had to cope with the situation and we are now slowly picking up.,He has worked with several artistes including Yvan Buravan, who he used to manage, Knowless Butera, Bruce Melodie, Meddy, The Ben and many others. Among the popular songs he has worked on are ‘We don’t care’ by Meddy and Rayvanny and ‘Thank you’ by Tom Close and The Ben.,Outside Rwanda, he has worked with artistes in DR Congo including ‘Prix Decouvertes’ winner Celine Mbanza, Stino, Gaz Mawete and Cappuccino, among others.,He is currently working on a project (which he couldn’t name), for Bruce Melodie and another one for the Goma-based singer Stino.,-,On social media platforms, he is known as a doting father, always involved in the raising of his two daughters who he co-parents with his ex-wife, popular socialite Shadia Mbabazi, commonly known as Shaddy Boo.,Despite parting ways, the couple continues to co-exist, at one point even appearing in Yvan Buravan’s video together, leading to speculation that they could get back together.,“Right now, I'm single. I have no issues with my children’s mother. We understand each other and yeah, it's very easy,” he says when asked about co-parenting, adding that he relates to his children in a manner that makes them ‘Daddy's girls’.,Meddy Saleh has six other siblings – three girls and four boys.

As part of the festival, the film has, alongside other selected films, been screening since March 1 and will end on March 14, after which they will announce the winners.,‘Lake Women’ is about a strong, determined woman who finds treasure on Lake Kivu, begins a quest to form the first Rwandan fisherwomen's group ever. Breaking traditional gender roles and norms, her “liberated women” makes history in Rwandan society by turning the patriarchal fishing community upside-down.,Deve Shema, a Rwandan filmmaker directed the film. The inspiration, he said, came about after he read a ,, in this paper, about a fisherwoman in Rusizi who was defying all odds to fend for his family through fishing.,Throughout his filmmaking career that started in 2015, Shema has so far made four films, eight short films, and another documentary that is currently in post-production. ‘Lake women’ for him, however, is a unique and special film because it tells of the unbeatable resilience and sacrifice of women.,“There has also been a lot of improvement from the other films I have done in terms of image, sound and storyline which have come from experience and learning which enabled pay attention to details throughout the entire production,” he added.,As he explained, Marianna, the main character in the documentary, goes fishing in the night but one of the fishermen went missing and so the others were scared but she encourages others to go. The men start mocking her and calling her names, but the other women are inspired to join her and soon form a group that operates independently from the men.,As a matter of fact, he shared, his next film project titled “Black Widow” is also a fictional story about women and fishing.,As the only boy in his family, raised by his sisters who sacrificed a lot after his mother passed at a tender age, he explains, is the reason why he is inclined to document about women.,“I have experienced how much sacrifice and love women give, and that is maybe why my themes are usually driven towards them,” he said.,About the production said: “We shot the film last year at the end of February in Rusizi, Nkombo Island.  The process of the whole project took me about five months and began attending after a workshop organised by Rwanda Media Project. The subject matter was one of the ideas that I submitted was picked by the organisers., Luckily, by the time we got to the lockdown, we were already editing with the help of the sponsors. We however had to edit online since they had moved back abroad and with internet connection problems, the completion of the film was delayed.”,Shema was in Form Three when he wrote his first short movie script. A radio show that talked about movies made him fall more in love with movies. He then met with Jerome Mugabo, a scriptwriter who introduced him to cinema and taught him to write scripts.,After high school, he attended his first-ever scriptwriting workshop at the Rwanda Christian Film Festival in 2013 and later Maisha Film Lab in 2015, shortly before directing his first film, ""Running."",He believes the challenges for all filmmakers are the same, but Rwandan filmmakers have achieved so much given the age of the industry and the experience.,“We still have a lot of skills to catch up with, but it’s amazing how much filmmakers in this country have achieved, beating odds to win awards continentally and globally. Also, our audience is also beginning to understand this kind of art form which has given us a boost.,We have investors who are setting up the Rwanda Film Office and we hope to market our films through the office,” he said.,Established in 1992, PAFF's goal is to present and showcase the broad spectrum of black creative works, particularly those that reinforce positive images and help destroy negative stereotypes. ,“Because the festival is happening online, we will not have interactions and networking with participants, which is how we grow our connections as filmmakers.,Although we will not meet people, my film will be known through the festival,” Shema said."

","THE MERE FACT that they are twins is an advantage for Gakondo duo Ange Ndayishimiye and Pamela Bamureke’s traditional music career.,The twins were rarely seen apart from their young age. They attended the same school, in the same class, from nursery to secondary school. Till today, you can hardly see either of them doing anything alone.,Unlike today however, the twins were identical from a very young age that was easy for them to cheat exams because teachers couldn’t tell them apart.,“When we were studying in the same class, I would help Pamela do some exams which were difficult for her and vice-versa. But, after they discovered our tricks, we got separated,” Ange said.,But now, they are inseparable in their music journey.,Ange and Pamela, their stage names, have been singing since nursery school, in a school cultural troupe and kept doing the same when they got promoted to primary school.  ,They were at the time not sure they were good at singing until they discovered that they have a singing talent at the age of 12.,“We discovered that it was our talent when we were 12 years of age. The talent developed and we are now composing our own songs,” said Pamela.,Ange and Pamela enjoyed a steady rise when they reached secondary school at College de Gisenyi ‘Inyemeramihigo’, in Rubavu District.,One day the school organised a singing competition which they won unopposed. A one Augrey Rugamba had, meanwhile, been monitoring their talent since they arrived at the school.,He admired their voices and proposed that they perform with him at weddings at a fee and it was this offer that kick-started their professional music career.,Their first experience singing at a wedding amazed guests who booked them to perform at future weddings.,“We got many offers from that wedding, and that is how we evolved,” said Ange.,From their tender age, Ange and Pamela have been fans of music legend Kamaliza.  They attribute their fame to the late musician whose songs topped their list while performing at weddings alongside those of Cecile Kayirebwa.,“It is sometimes sad to sing and enjoy one's songs when you know you never meet her. I am sure that if she had been alive we would have learned a lot more from her. We love her so much, and we don't want her songs to be forgotten. When you sing Kamaliza's songs, she remains alive and people keep thinking about her. She means a lot to us,” said Ange.,Growing a career in the hands of Kayirebwa,One of the songs that Ange and Pamela performed at cultural events was Cecile Kayirebwa’s song was 'Marebe Atemba Amaribori'.,It was because of the same song that the duo were able to meet the music icon when she was conducting auditions for backup singers prior to her concert back in 2016.,Mentored by their school matron, they did a series of rehearsals about the song and attended the auditions., “We went on stage and began singing.  Before we could complete the song, she was already emotional. She hugged us, amidst tears saying that we were the perfect fit,” Ange recalls.,Ange and Pamela have since been backing Kayirebwa at each of the concerts that she has performed at.,The duo made a lot of money performing Kamaliza and Kayirebwa’s songs at different cultural events until Kayirebwa encouraged them to start producing their songs last year.,“We performed other people's songs and earned money, but never thought of composing our own songs. It was Kayirebwa who, before the pandemic broke out, told us that we should go to the studio and record our own song,” Ange said.,The motivation to do even more songs came after Kayirebwa admired the talent they had shown when they recorded their debut song 'Rusengo',“When she listened to it, she loved it and asked us why we had taken that long. We also noticed public's positive feedback was, which motivated us to compose other songs,” said Pamela.,Since last year, the twins have so far released three more songs including ‘Impundu Zanjye’, a collaboration with Kayirebwa, ‘Gwera’ and their latest song ‘Ndamurika’, which they released last month.,After years of performing Kamaliza and Kayirebwa’s songs at different cultural events, Ange and Pamela are now focused on pulling out of the music icon’s shadows and producing more songs, although they intend to keep performing Kamariza’s songs at cultural events to keep her music alive.,“We still sing songs by Cecile and Kamariza because we love them and their songs. We envision a brighter and better future beyond our imagination. Pamela and I can never be discouraged by anything,” says Ange.,Apart from singing, Ange was a model before she shifted to fashion design. She now owns a fashion house called ‘Hodan Fashion’ whose collections were showcased in the video of their latest song, ‘Ndamurika’"

But we are negotiating with DSTV and the negotiations are in advanced stages,” Ndahiro said.,He added that the show is not what Rwandans are used to, but it must happen for a new experience to meet people from different countries and learn the different cultures from other African countries.,Ndahiro said Rwanda will benefit from the reality TV show because it will give the country big visibility as it will be followed by hundreds of millions across the globe.,“The show will hopefully boost the ‘Visit Rwanda’ campaign. It will be an opportunity to showcase the beauty of the country hence attracting people to visit the country,” he said.,Rwanda, as the host, will be having a representative in the Residence Africa next year.,The last time a Rwandan attended a reality TV show was in 2014 when comedian Arthur Nkusi and musician Frankie Joe contested in the Big Brother Africa season 9 held in Johannesburg."

She is the project manager for Ikiringo, a project that aims at protecting and promoting local dances in Rwanda. Using her social media platform, she is showcasing her project to convince the public to give her a chance to make it to the next stage of the pageant.,Another contestant is 21-year-old Linda Nkusi Uwankusi (No.32) had the option of working at her mother’s business after completing her secondary school studies in Literature, Economics and Geography back in 2019 but she chose to exploit her parents’ farm in Masaka, Kicukiro District, and started growing a cash crop which, she said, is largely wanted by both local and foreign processing factories.,Doing agribusiness is a rare trend for the majority of youth, especially those who were born and raised in Kigali. However, through her project, Uwankusi wants to change that mindset.,“I could have joined her (mother) business, but I thought it would be a good idea to exploit our land with an agricultural project. And I didn’t regret it because the market is open for my production and I am already giving a job to fellow youth,” she said.,With the Miss Rwanda crown, she believes her voice would sound more influential while mobilizing initiatives oriented in encouraging and engaging more youth in agribusiness.,“This is a sector that not only the majority of the country’s population depends on but whose volume of production is still smaller than the current market demand from local factories and foreign ones. With my experience, I want to show my fellow youth the opportunities and benefits existing in this sector so I can inspire them to show appetite in investing in it,” she said.,A lot has been said since contestant Lea Umutesi (27) was , in order to mobilize his 6.4 million Instagram followers to vote for her in the ongoing Miss Rwanda 2021 voting exercise.,A Year Three university student in Travel and Tourism Management, Umutesi told local media outlets that it’s no surprise that the Tanzanian singer showed her the support because they are ‘friends’ and that he sometimes visits her family.,She dismissed any rumors linking her to a relationship with the singer and said that he knew the singer’s platform would help boost her votes.,Kiba’s post has shaken the Miss Rwanda 2021 voting rankings which saw Umutesi go fourth, as it stands, from 14th, a position at which she sat before the post., A host of names in this year’s Miss Rwanda editions are familiar to the beauty contest, having contested in previous editions, failed but have no intentions of giving up the crown.,The likes of Hope Akaliza (Eastern), Teta Hense Musana, Evelyne Gaju and Claudette Umwaliwase (all representing Kigali City) are not new to the pageant after they failed to impress in last year’s edition.   ,They took enough time to follow the entire contest and their experience, however small or big it is, could help them go a step forward this year if they worked on the mistakes that previously made them fail.,Voting online is ongoing via IGIHE’s website, while SMS voting continues via MTN line by typing ‘MISS’ space ‘Number of a contestant’ and sending it to 1525."

","When rapper , officially started his music career in 2010, he was the only rapper on the scene in a gospel music industry dominated by other genres at the time.,He said hip hop in general was not welcomed even in secular music at the time.,“Technically, I was facing the same challenges as other rappers who were breaking through in secular music back then. But I think it was more difficult and challenging for me, starting from pastors and evangelists...to people in churches, you can imagine how tough the fight was,” he narrates.,Despite the challenges, the rapper knew that it was his calling to do gospel rap music. That’s what has pushed him to be the artiste he is now.,Though his journey had a difficult beginning, the Canada-based singer says that there were a number of people who supported him in churches, most importantly the media.,For him, the perception has completely changed in the last 10 years given that there are a bunch of rappers out there who are doing good, including the likes of gospel female rapper The Pink, and the fact that other rappers joined the movement.,However, the number of rappers successfully doing gospel music is obviously low and some blame the trend on the fact that Hip Hop artistes are not given the same treatment as other artistes, both in churches and in the media from which they expect to promote their music.,As a result, some rappers decide to switch their careers to secular music while others quit music because their favorite genre is hardly welcomed.,For Bright Patrick, a large number of pastors are to blame for the modest treatment of rappers in churches because they don’t support artists doing Hip Hop.,""Some of them don’t really value artistes, they talk to them only when they need to use them for concerts, fundraising, or conferences, but other than that. There is no other connection, guidance or some kind of follow-up, as a result, some artists stop doing music or go to secular music,” he said.,He, however, hailed some churches that support their own artists financially, morally, spiritually and emotionally, something that all churches should pick a leaf from.,Besides public perception that,ip-hop, whether Gospel or secular, is not well seen in Rwandan society, , says it gets worse when it comes to female rappers.,In a telephone interview with ,, The Pink claimed most churches perceive female rappers as just a rapper and not as a Christian who is trying to spread the gospel as the other gospel singers and that made her feel like rappers are not given value in churches.,“People were not used to seeing females doing that in churches…so of course sometimes I was rejected. It really hurts, but it made me think twice about why I am doing this genre. I am not here to make rap music famous in churches but to testify that God has been good to me and that Jesus can change people’s lives,” she said.,According to the female rapper’s experience, churches are on the spot having no, or little, room for hip-hop music just because of the bad perception of the genre in society, particularly in churches.,“One day I was invited to a church concert...and I reached there early because I wanted to leave early... I was surprised to see other artists performing before me, and at the end, someone came and told me that the pastor told them not to give me the stage,” the female rapper narrates.,“This also happened in one school where I was invited. The headmaster said I couldn't sing because I was doing Hip Hop,” she adds.,Despite such treatment, The Pink never gave up, saying that it was just a matter of time before the situation improved and that seeing a new generation in churches supporting Hip Hop boosted her hopes to carry on.,“People will stop judging, and even if they don't, whoever is doing hip hop should think why he is doing it and if it is reasonable, I don't see why they should mind what people think. For me, I do what I feel I have to do despite what people think. When I have a message to deliver,” she said.,Another challenge, according to Bright Patrick, is that many gospel rappers are not in the spotlight because they lack promotion for their music hence not many people get to know their music.,Eddy Kamoso, a local journalist who hosts a gospel music talk show on Radio 10, claimed that there are presenters who don’t play Hip Hop gospel songs because they are influenced by the beliefs of their churches.,Kamoso has been doing gospel shows over the past decade and is one of those who promoted the music of rapper MC Mahoniboni.,He recalls that some pastors used to ask him why he plays Hip Hop.,“But they had no control over how I was doing my job. To the presenters who have such beliefs, it’s not professional and I don't see why I can’t play Hip Hop songs as long as they carry the word of God.  I’ve been promoting local music over the past decade and Hip Hop is no exception,” he said.,“The mindset has to change from churches and then to presenters because Hip Hop has the power to spread the word of God, especially the young generation,” he added."

However, he still lacked a sense of direction.,One time, while watching TV on one of the local channels, they hosted an artist who explained how he was earning from his art. That young artist inspired Ndayizeye as he yearned to be just like him. ,He decided to use his talent to enliven the young generation but also start his own business, and he hasn’t looked back.,In 2017, he officially started his small art business although he still operates from his parents’ home in Gisozi. He has been able to gain clients, and afford art materials even though they are expensive. ,His challenge, however, is that art requires time and expertise to perfect, sometimes he is paid peanuts or nothing at all, as its market is still lacking locally. At times he works under pressure anticipating to be paid, only to be disappointed by clients. ,He believes that there should be more sensitisation about the value of art in the media, and from other platforms or concerned bodies, otherwise artists will still work under losses and ingratitude. ,When asked whether he would choose any other profession, he says no, because art is able to say things that words sometimes can’t. It’s a global language that anyone from anywhere can apprehend and be inspired by.,In addition, he notes that art is therapy for stress and mental health, like many health experts say. ,“With paint, or any art materials, I am able to be more creative. Art also assists in the development of motor skills (a learned ability to cause a predetermined movement outcome with maximum certainty),” he says. ,The cartoonist explains that if all people cherished art, the world would be a better place as art makes people positive about the future. But also through art, a message of motivation can be spread—making people achieve great things in life and focus on common issues for the refinement of humankind. ,He has started offering art training to some of his colleagues. He is also currently undertaking a short course in animation at African Digital Media Academy in Kigali."

I have three songs now including ‘35 Bars’ a freestyle that I released in 2019, ‘L’Inverse’, which I dropped in April 2020. This one is more of a commemoration song dedicated to my dad and grandfather killed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi.  My latest song is ‘Kuva’ that I released in December last year.,I would say tough, mostly for two reasons: It is expensive and it requires resources, especially when it comes to visuals. Another challenge is the promotion of music, which is even harder when you are away from home and want to market your music locally.,Not really. That used to be my worst fear all those years I was not doing music. However, people (fans) and the media proved me wrong.  Fans would slide in my direct messages on social media to let me know how much my music is missed and if I am contemplating releasing new music—stuff like that—and this is still happening even today. So this is my main motivation, and it’s a confirmation that there are people out there who still appreciate my music and need more of it.  But the interesting part is that there is a new generation that needs to listen to my music as well, I have to make sure they are served too.,I will keep releasing good music and going with trends, musically, and promote my music via local media and different social platforms. I believe that when you try to bring the best out of yourself, God also blesses what you do."

This disease has stolen from us for too long, stopping people from working and children from going to school,”,“Even now, malaria is still taking the life of a young child every two minutes. We can change this, we can overtake this preventable, treatable disease and end it in my lifetime. Join me and let’s draw the line against malaria once and for all,” Kipchoge said.,Although 90 per cent of life-saving malaria prevention campaigns were delivered as planned in 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that disruption to malaria diagnosis and treatment could lead to thousands of additional deaths across the African continent.,Before the Covid-19 pandemic half of the world’s population were already living with the threat of malaria and, despite promising progress since the beginning of the millennium, the parasite is fighting back.,The most recent WHO Malaria Report, shows that now is not the time to step away with 229 million new infections and over 400,000 malaria deaths reported in 2019. The vast majority of these deaths are young children under five across sub-Saharan Africa.,Rwanda accounts for 2 per cent of all malaria cases and 1 per cent of all malaria deaths but in recent years, the number of malaria cases has declined rapidly, and incidence fell by nearly 50 per cent between 2017 and 2019—thanks to the Government of Rwanda efforts."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/entertainment/hell-spreading-gospel-story-rapper-ga-yell," From ‘hell’ to spreading the gospel: The story of rapper Ga-Yell
","Those who knew Gael Tunga Rutembesa as a student at University of Rwanda in Huye District, currently Huye District, know the kind of person he was.,Rutembesa, 34, is a gospel rapper whose music is inspired by his past, including his years at university as a playboy, a drug user and a drunken young man.,But the story behind his switch to gospel music is undoubtedly a lesson for everyone who lives the same life.,The rapper who uses Ga-Yell as his stage name, decided to do gospel music to share his life experience and inspire those who might be living the same life he used to live to make them change.,The gospel rapper, 34, told , that he regrets the time lost during his university days, before he surrendered his life to God in 2012., “I liked to party a lot, drink, smoke cigarettes, drugs…, weed was the only drug, and sleeping around with girls,” he narrates.,“My university years were the darkest years of my life because I was living a dark life and it was killing me inside. But now I gave it to Christ, it changed my mind, soul renewed and made clean,” he added.,Ga-Yell says nobody advised him to change. It was just a matter of time before he gave his life a new direction., When he finished university in 2012, he returned to Kigali to start a new life after school, got a job but kept living the same lifestyle while in University, including sleeping with girls with no intention of getting into a relationship because he thought it would spoil his fun.,One day, he got a pregnancy scare and he felt like it was over for him.,“That wasn’t my first pregnancy scare, but that time round, it was different because I thought: ‘if this girl gets pregnant, her school is going to stop for a while’. I felt like a roadblock in her life journey, on one hand, and, on the other hand, I really didn’t know how I was going to support her because I was not ready to become a father, especially not someone I was not going to marry,” he recalls.,The situation the rapper was going through reminded him that he could find the right solution through prayer, his rare habit then, as growing up, he merely attended a Catholic Church only on Easter or Christmas.,That time round, however, he went to his room when no one at home, and prayed to God.,“A wave came by and covered me from my head all the way to my toes. In one second I was in total peace and I knew that I was touched by God. Even if I doubted, I could not doubt what happened to me in a second. That moment I knew God told me ‘I forgive you but it’s time to change your life,” he said.,A week later, the girl called Ga-Yell and told him she was not pregnant and, since then, he has been spreading the word of God through music that mostly shares his life’s journey.,“I gave my life to Christ and that was when I realised that my life is for a purpose and my love for music and telling stories inspired me to share what God has done for me in my life. The main reason I do gospel music is to show people that God is real because He is working,” he said.,Before Ga-Yell switched to Gospel music, he was an underground rapper in secular music.,But after deciding to carry on his career in gospel music, things couldn’t click right away. He had to wait for some time to settle for a new life and figure out how to thrive in an industry dominated by the likes of Israel Mbonyi, Patient Bizimana and Serge Iyamuremye among others.,“The journey has been up and down. It took me long to experience new styles of music, learning about the music industry,” he said.,In the meantime, Ga-Yell took some time off to build a life with a wife he married in 2018 before returning to studio, in 2019, consistently investing his time recording songs that comprise of his debut album, ‘What You Got’, which he dropped the same year.,The 10-song album is based on Moses’ story in the Bible describing specifically, when he used to cry out to God that he wasn’t able to lead the Israelites because there were still too many miles away from Egypt to Canaan.,“God told him [Moses] to use the rod to divide the Red Sea into two parts to find a way for Israelites.  Moses was able to do so many things with that rod and for me, bringing this into today’s life, I was trying to spread the message that whatever you have and however small it is, with God, it can be used to do great things,” he said of his album.,A year after releasing the album, the rapper released a seven-song Extended Play (EP) inspired by the first lockdown last year, when all activities were halted by the Covid-19 outbreak., “I spent a lot of time reflecting on life and God and I started writing new songs.,I noticed that, with every song that I wrote, I kept writing ‘In Your Hands’. And it was all about leaving my life in God’s hands because, outside of them, I can have so many plans but something like a pandemic may come and stop everything that, basically, I have no control over,” he added.,So, the best place that can be, no matter what happens-good or bad, is in God’s hands and that’s how the EP came about,” he explained.,His latest songs ‘Adam Saw Eve’, which he dropped last week and ‘In Your Hands’ that came out last month are part of the seven-track EP that the rapper is recording.,
	The singer wants to see his music spread all over the world and, on top of that, see it impacting people and showing them the way to God. "

At least in my opinion!,I have been a guitarist for seven years now and my early dreams were to play for Teta Diana before I ushered in on a solo career. Positively in 2020, Covid-19 reminded me to listen to other genres of music aside from my usual instrumentals playlists, acquired a new habit to listen to albums one at a time and drew my attention to ""Iwanyu"" album that gets more versatile and culturally rich as the genres, rhythms and message vary but going really deeper with diversity as opposed to how Teta is now mostly known for traditional songs.,""I started working on this album in 2017 and it’s fulfilling to know that it exists today and as a full live record. Any instrument you hear is a human touch and natural dynamics from a band of eleven musicians that we rehearsed together for four months. I really put in all I had from message, and melody to structure and Didier Touch whom I worked with for more than ten years helped with arrangement. I'm so indebted to the whole team that was a part of the journey."" Says Teta.,Music is like breathing, we exhale what we inhale but exhaled air smells differently depending on who and that's the beauty of Teta’s music. It’s like she listened to Richard Bona, Khadja Nin, Cécile Kayirebwa, Kool and the Gang, Chronixx, Toumani Diabaté, Rugamba Cyprien and Gonzalo Bergara Quartet sorta playlist along with learning history and living her own experience just to create “Iwanyu” album in its own way that it is.,Aside from being such a great musical artist, Teta creatively writes songs from day to day life experience, conversations and more. Like ""See me"" is a song on the album that calls out racism and is inspired by her experienceabroad. She also spends a lot of time researching Rwandan History as a part of her creative writing process. Her song ""None n'ejo"" talks about Nyampinga, (""Traditionally a girl who would get married to a man from the neighbouring hill to end the conflict."") a girl from a thousand hills country with rare ability to call the tune and harmoniously unite society. ,""Birangwa"", a very nostalgic song with such eloquent lyrics dedicated to his father and all those missing theirs dearly. Titled the same as the Album ""Iwanyu"" and poem ""Ijuru ryanjye"" explain why nowhere is like home, Teta shares especially her affinity for Rwanda's Gasabo surroundings. The tracklist goes on with love songs and her popular song ""Ndaje"" that talk about the history of Rwanda and encourage new generations to contribute to a better future of unity and humanity.,""If you're to work on album project that will last three years, you're surely going to face challenges be financial, geo boundaries and become more of a victim if you're like myself who doesn't want to let her creativity get limited by labels (because who pays for something ofcourse controls it) but rather keep on fine-tuning the process independently and enjoy the results as much because you know the hustle it takes"" Said Teta,I believe that you can't force writing, you need to be inspired first and if I run out of inspiration I would take time to recharge unlike being label's money machine. Also self-management enlightens me so much about the music industry and gets me better at it everyday. And the roadmap is clearer that I, myself get to know exactly who consumes my music."" She adds.,Iwanyu"" CDs are currently on sale and my signed copy stroke a chord with me by just how even creative and professional was the design from cover, lyrics book which features sign language saying ""Iwanyu"" and to the middle pages with Illustration that shows the harmony between Rwanda and Belgium.,Buying ""Iwanyu"" Album on streaming platforms and giving it undivided attention, is only a reveal of the hidden legacy in the making. Teta’s debut mini-album (EP) of four songs including recent release ""Agashinge"" is coming out soon. Know what's what about it."

","On Monday, February 22, music streaming platform Spotify announced expansion into 80+ new markets around the world including Rwanda, Angola, Ghana, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, among others.,The announcement was greeted with optimism by many Rwandans on social media but more so, musicians and music producers, who believe that the music streaming service will be a good source of revenue for artistes.,Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider, which was launched in October 2008. The platform is owned by Spotify AB, a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange since 2018 through its holding company Spotify Technology S.A. based in Luxembourg.,Many Rwandans took to social media to express their feelings, some saying that it has been long overdue, even though some people have been able to access the platform through proxy means.,At a time when concerts are still off limits due to the Covid-19 pandemic, artistes getting an opportunity to have their music streamed and get paid for it is such a timely development that players in the music industry have welcomed it with open hands.,“Among other things, it will help in maximizing streams, ensure direct payments of generated income without using third parties,” says Pius Rukabuza, known as DJ Pius, who is also a singer and manages other artistes under 1K Entertainment,“Artistes can now sell their music before releasing them in Rwanda (pre-saving) on Spotify,” DJ Pius adds.,Singer Alyn Sano, who has been one of the most hardworking artistes in the last year or so, believes the addition of Spotify is an opportunity for artistes to make extra revenue, adding to the already existing platforms.,“I just heard about it. For real it is a big deal because we are going to start getting revenues from the platform just as much as we were on other platforms like Mdundo and Youtube,” the “Joni” singer said.,Nigerian singer Burna Boy, who is among the stars that announced the entry of Spotify on key African markets, said that the platform will be very important for up-and-coming artistes who see what their elders are doing, learn from them and want to do even better.,“If the younger generation sees that the older generation is doing something and that they are successful, then they get to be interested in that thing and then they probably come out and do it better than their Elders,” Burna Boy said.,The “On the Low” singer said that Africa has abundant talent, all they just need is the backing, referring to his own experience when he started out, uploading his music on different platforms and people all over the world picked interest. ,“If everyone in Africa had Spotify and everyone experienced different music and different cultures, I mean it is important because the world deserves to have access to that,” Burna Boy said in his promo video.,Lee Ndayisaba, the founder of Cloud9 Entertainment and current manager of singer Bruce Melodie, said Rwanda getting on Spotify is a big deal,“It is big. First, as a country, this is good that we are getting recognised as we should. Second, people don't have to circumvent country restrictions to access the platform. It's a good step in content democratisation,” Ndayisaba says.,The same sentiments are shared by singer Yvan Buravan, who also thinks artistes will be able to generate some revenues through the music streaming platform.,“Yes, it is a big deal for our music, because its business to artistes and a way of support from fans to their artistes. And besides all that, its growth and expansion for the Rwandan music industry,” says the “Low Key” singer.,Gospel artistes also have an opportunity to stream their music on Spotify. Singer Aline Gahongayire, says she is ‘super happy’ that Rwandan music can now directly be streamed via Spotify, while Patient Bizimana also says that being on the biggest streaming platform will elevate Rwandan music.,“This is a huge opportunity for us as artistes. Spotify as one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world will help our music to be sold online without going through third parties as we were doing before, thus getting paid directly,” Bizimana says.,“For me, it is also an opportunity to think about how to expand my music internationally in terms of the language I sing in so that it can be heard beyond Rwanda and be recommended to many people across the world,” he adds.,Jean-Paul Nduwimana, aka Noopja, an investor in the entertainment industry and proprietor of Country Records, says that Rwanda getting on Spotify is a chance all artistes should grab with both hands.,“First of all, I can say that it’s another opportunity for Rwandan artistes and the whole music industry in general. Nowadays, the digital market is one of the best ways for artistes to sell their products,”,“On my side as an artiste and studio label owner, I am really happy. I encourage artistes to make their music and start selling it digitally. I don’t know well how Spotify pays, but from what I hear it’s one of the best platforms that pay well for streaming music,” Nduwimana adds.,However, music personality and founder of AFROGROOV, Eric ‘Soul’ Kirenga Karengera, says that though it is a big deal, there are other requirements that must be put in place for people to reap the benefits. He also believes that ‘small artistes’ stand limited chances.,“Big deal is relative, because we have weak legal framework, policies and regulation as well as limited support infrastructure when it comes to music and musicians,”,“It may be a case of adding Rwandan artistes to the list of international artists being exploited by Spotify. Let's not forget this is a B2B streaming service that mainly benefits big corporate structure with huge catalogue, big leverage, already deep pockets and top tier artistes with a gigantic fan base,” Kirenga says.,The experienced music curator believes those already big are the ones mainly benefiting from the music streaming services.,“As for Rwandan artistes, the more educated and digitally literate they are, the better tooled up they are to use the service to their advantage but make no mistake,”,“Spotify is not a cash cow that will pay you just because you put music there. Artistes and their teams will need to do some serious homework to be able to reap any benefits,” advises Kirenga.,In recent years, Spotify has been able to improve its mobile app design, usability, streaming quality, and music sharing capabilities, ultimately making it one of the best music streaming platforms in the world.,As of December 2020, the platform had 345 million monthly active users, including 155 million paying subscribers but that number is expected to grow with the addition of 85 new countries, making it available in 171 countries worldwide. The platform generated about $7.8 billion in 2020."

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/weekender/advice-my-younger-self-relationships-matter,Advice For My Younger Self: Relationships Matter,"Have you ever been on a panel where they ask you the advice you would give your younger self? It is a recurring question and a good one at that. A lot of career women who are now in leadership roles did not have the luxury of seeing female role models in senior management and executive roles when they were entering the workforce themselves. Today’s world is different: such questions are being asked and there are role models out there doing it all. An inspirational video circulating on social media showed Oprah Winfrey who answered this question with the following advice: “Relax. Be patient. Life has such beautiful experiences in store for you.” Although I am not Oprah and never will be, I share this feeling. Today’s article is my own attempt at answering this question.,Patience is a virtue. One that we often overlook or underestimate at a younger age. We are in a rush to prove ourselves worthy, capable or simply ‘enough’. We hurry to make money and to make a name for ourselves.,Sometimes as we are on this rat race to success, we go lightly over something that is incredibly important – especially to reach the highest levels of the career ladder – and that something is called a relationship.,Professional relationships are crucial because nothing happens without people.,Where there are people there are relationships, whether you acknowledge them or not. Trying to get the most out of the first few interactions to the point of damaging or even ending the professional relationship is not a winning strategy, it is a short-sighted approach. Want to power charge your career? Invest in your professional relationships! Read on and find out how.,Give first and give generously,Just because you do not have more money or power than the person you are trying to approach, does not mean you have nothing to give. If you are alive and part of the human family, you have something to give – be it time, attention, your unique perspective, a connection or anything else. Come with a proposal, a gift, or offer of help – not a demand or a request. The former is how professional relationships blossom, the latter makes them die prematurely. We often talk about respect being earned, but so is a relationship. It takes initial effort and continuous upkeep through both giving and receiving.,“A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.”,~ James Keller,Support one another in important times,We are all in our own comfortable bubble – experiencing our lives and our careers from our own perspective, in our specific work environment with our own personal and professional goals. So my areas of interest, events of importance to me, topics that matter to me or moments that are deeply significant to me will be different from the experience and priorities of others.,If you value a professional relationship share the other person or company’s moments of glory, milestones and show up when you are invited. We know this from weddings and burials, for professional relationships it should be no different. Show up when it matters most to those professional contacts around you. Timing is important and the world does not revolve around you – just your experience of it.,Respect the relationship over all else,Honor the trust you are given.,So you have someone’s contact number. You communicate on WhatsApp and see their great profile picture. You took a picture of someone and want to use it in social media. Use your judgement and if you are not sure, check with the person first. It is not okay to take someone’s WhatsApp profile picture and use it in your next Tweet or in your LinkedIn post… check first. Don’t use someone’s head shot without checking if it is alright. It takes a little more time, but can save you a lot of trouble.,Trust takes time to win, but is easily broken. Do not take such matters lightly. For in the end such small needs come and go, but relationships – if valued and respected – can last for a lifetime.,“So, my dear younger self, don’t rush. Take your time to build strong, lasting relationships, as nothing happens without people and you sure want things to happen, don’t you?!”,Lucy Schalkwijk speaks and writes about the topics of leadership development, empowerment and diversity, networking and skills development.

","A glance at Inshuti Art and Culture Centre will leave you glued to one of the great pieces exhibited at the gallery.,The masterpiece, titled, ‘The Long Trek’, by seven young visual artists, tells a true story of Clementine Nyirabazungu, from Musanze District.,Born with disabilities, Nyirabazungu is a 15-year-old girl, who used to move in an old wheelchair, too hard to push due to its weariness and tear. Besides being unable to walk she also has a speech disorder.,Through this piece of art, they tell a true story about the girl who inspired them to create an inclusive centre so as to tell her story and touch the hearts of others to give and help others in different ways.,Godfrey Kalungi, Timothy Wandulu, Daniel Rukundo, Patrick Gusenga, Olivier Hodari, Solange Uwase, T. Pacifique and Bienvenue Mashakiro are the brains behind Inshuti Art and Culture Centre, in Musanze District, where they also hail from.,While in their 20s and early 30s, these artists’ story began when some of the members occasionally met Nyirabazungu on the street, begging for food and money.,Before that, the group worked as visual artists, although they would meet on rare occasions.,“Upon seeing her one morning being pushed in her wheelchair by her younger brother, we were captured by the state of her chair with the sounds it made on the rough road. We noticed this for a few weeks until one morning while working on the centre’s outdoor sculptures, we decided to wait for her to pass by so we could approach her,” narrates Godfrey Kalungi, one of the founders.,Kalungi, who is also the proprietor of the art centre, said they wanted to know more about her struggles and the brother that takes care of her.,Nyirabazungu and her brother used to wake up early in the morning to start on a long six hour’s journey to town, and at times they would go back without getting any coin, yet most of the time they went on an empty stomach.,The wheel chair had no rubber tyres, and parts of it had worn out, were rusty and had one front tyre, while the back metallic tyres were bent due to the stony roads they rode through town.,They soon realised, after visiting the girl’s home and seeing the conditions she was living in with her family, that they truly needed help.,This inspired them to extend their friendship to them and procured a modern, new wheelchair for the girl, which brightened the smile on her face.,The group then used an old wheelchair to create an artwork that would connect their family with the community.,Besides supporting Nyirabazungu and her family, the younger brother has been able to resume school, with the help of the group.,Meanwhile, the artists have also taken in a young girl whose mother has been sick of cancer for years. But the story, they said, was more of Nyirabazungu since they met her on the streets as well.,Since the inception of Inshuti Art and Culture Centre in 2016, the group has been carrying out community outreach to educate the community on art and craft, especially to the young generation.,They host student sessions in the creative part, and promote and expose dress culture and fashion in general at the centre.,The artists say they are dedicated to telling the untold stories of vulnerable Rwandans through art, training children in dancing, providing them with scholastic materials, offering painting classes, as well as hosting school tour visits.,They also promote talent, facilitate and lead student creative tours.,Apart from motivational talks, the girls are trained on making jewellery, which the group believes helps keep them occupied and prevents cases of early pregnancies, which are on the rise among young girls.,Through the centre, the group has managed to pay community health insurance for at least 20 people and offer scholastic materials to 32 school-going children.,“We also collect and sell crafts from local communities generating income and offering employment to some members of the community,” adds Kalungi.,To carry out all these activities, the artists say they use their savings from their art work and other side gigs."

Yet, there are so many beautiful art pieces out there created by women,” Vivaldi Ngenzi, the manager of Rwanda Art Museum, told ,on Wednesday.,She added: “Also, all the art galleries that we have around are owned by men. This is why we thought of organising an exhibition to help women become visible and connect with other people. The exhibi-tion will be celebrating women’s creativity and power in fine art.”,Different art collections, ranging from paintings of 3D canvass, conceptual art and collage to drawings, will be on display at the museum.,, one of the expected exhibitors, said that she is excited to be part of the upcoming event as it is something she has looked forward to.,“I believe that since we are the ones who understand, better than anyone else, issues that affect women in our daily lives, we have to address them and work together to find solutions.,“We are the ones who have to tell our stories and find solutions as women. It matters who tells our story and when our work inspires you, it’s important that you say it out loud and let everyone know that we are here and are making a difference. No one should erase the work of women,” she said.,Kakizi noted that the exhibitors will gain visibility and be able to express their thoughts with the world, adding that the public will learn from them.,“There are many subjects that people rarely talk about or open up about, yet they are important be-cause they play a big role in improving social conditions,” she added."

This pandemic has only revealed our true colours and they sure aren’t pretty. The masks and gloves are off, with well-off nations making it clear they intend to snatch every available vaccine.,At this rate, they’ll oversee inoculations of their nationals’ pets and plants before medics and other priority groups across Africa and elsewhere get a shot. And we wonder why some people are turning to herbal concoctions for protection! It’s the panic buying frenzy yet again, even though vaccine hesitancy and sceptism even in the developed world means they probably won’t use up all the vials they’re stockpiling, at which point someone will realise that the vaccines are near expiration and suddenly think to donate to Africa like we didn’t participate in vaccine trials! All those WHO cautionary reminders about nobody being safe until all countries are free of the virus appear to have fallen on deaf ears.,Would be interesting if the most effective vaccines had been developed on this continent. We’re often lauded for our hospitality and kindness so we probably wouldn’t hoard stocks because sharing is the right thing to do. EU commissioners who’ve been vocal about how their respective governments spent millions to fund vaccine research and development remind me of benefactors who throw their weight around and make all kinds of demands simply because they made a donation.

","Ange has a secret account that her husband knows nothing about. In her defence, she says her husband is an insincere person and that she can’t trust him, at least not with her money.,She says she set up this account in case their marriage went south. “I wouldn’t want to find myself in a puzzling state. I want to have options and not be tied to a marriage because I am too broke to live on my own,” she says.,Conflicting financial beliefs amongst couples are known to be a common cause for divorce, however, hiding money is a whole different kind of trouble for married couples.,When married, keeping money secrets from your partner is called financial infidelity. ,Financial infidelity is also defined as spending money, possessing credit or credit cards and holding secret accounts without the knowledge of one’s spouse, partner, or significant other.,Counsellor Shadia Nansasi says financial infidelity can ruin a marriage when it is discovered. ,When a partner learns that their significant other is holding such secrets from them, they are bound to lose trust in them. This is one of the worst things that can happen in a marriage, Nansasi says.,She explains that in most cases, people keep financial secrets from their partners to avoid getting into a fight over money or covering up something else such as an addiction or an affair.,“This can deeply hurt a relationship or marriage by cutting out the possibility for a couple to count on each other. Hiding such important information can cause wounds that can’t be easily healed, which causes deeper cracks in a marriage,” she adds.,Aaron Mugwaneza has been married for over five years now. His observation on this goes down to a couple’s intimacy or bond. ,He notes that such problems are often a result of deeper issues affecting a marriage. He argues that any person who does that or thinks of doing it should look deeper into their marriage for underlying issues that need to be addressed.,“For a person to do this to the one they chose to share a life with, there has to be a factor that is amiss. Hiding money from a spouse can be a symptom of a deeper problem in the relationship; this can be fear or lack of trust,” he says.,Author Chris Sonzogni reflects on a similar view, noting that hiding financial transactions from a partner can worsen tensions in an already stressed relationship, potentially leading to its demise. Why someone feels compelled to hide their spending, particularly once it’s reached a point they can no longer afford to keep hidden, may not always be clear.,As a way of overcoming this challenge, Sonzogni recommends for couples to default to transparency.,There is no magic bullet for overcoming the fear, guilt, and anxiety of being completely transparent about your spending. One key to developing the habit is enforcing a default reaction in yourself: open and frequent communication, without exception, especially if only one member of the partnership retains control over the household’s finances.,Nansasi notes that the best way to handle or avoid this situation altogether is for married people to have a clear budget that they follow and stick to as a couple. ,She also recommends approaching the problem with a rational mind and refrain from making accusations or fast conclusions.,“This would make things worse. Avoid attacking or blaming your spouse, don’t make any conclusion before you listen to their side of the story. Figure out exactly what happened and understand why it happened in the first place.  What is more important, however, is for the couple to be willing to open up and address this issue from the root cause,” she says."

","Rogers came to realise he was truly exhausting his girlfriend after months of dating her. He had always wondered why she fought constant mood swings, till later when he came to realise that it was his constant dumping of emotions on her that always sent her in that mood.,He says he never opened up when something was bothering him in their relationship, and this always troubled her a lot. But instead of irritating him, she would do all she could to ensure that he was okay.,He, however, now understands how damaging this is to her and he says he is doing his best to be there for her as well. ,Relationship experts explain that the mutual emotional give-and-take is called emotional labour.,To ensure that a relationship doesn’t fall apart, effort has to be put into it. Both partners need to play their part in order to keep it afloat, though this isn’t always the case.,David Kabagambe almost called off his wedding late last year because he couldn’t handle his fiancée’s lack of care.,He says, he was always the one to apologise even when he wasn’t in wrong, and this made him question their relationship.,“I wondered the type of marriage we were going to build. I was the only one putting in all the effort for us to work and this bothered me a lot. I saw this as disrespect, at some point I thought she didn’t love me. But when I brought up the issue she apologised and we are now okay,” he says.,Counsellor Robina Ziwa says though it’s hard for both partners to put in equal effort in building a relationship, it is necessary for both parties to make effort in sharing this load. ,She notes that a person is assured to be emotionally drained if they are the ones to always talk things out after a fight, or compromise their boundaries more than the other.,“It can be exhausting for a partner taking on most of the emotional labour in a relationship. But before it gets worse, you need to communicate and let your significant other understand how it makes you feel. This can be an eye opener because some people don’t realise they are hurting you when they do certain things in relationships,” she says.,“At times our actions are a reflex of behaviours or patterns we are used to. So, if you keep quiet thinking they know or do what they do on purpose, this might not help and end up damaging you and the relationship,” she adds.,She sheds more light citing that understanding that no relationship is perfect can also be helpful in dealing with this.,“Don’t be quick to come to conclusions, someone might be good in some areas but weak in others, therefore appreciate that as you give them time to adjust. Don’t be quick to write them off, view your marriage or relationship as a work in progress. This will give you room to comprise with slipups,” she explains.,The counsellor, however, emphasises the need for both parties in a relationship to make it their goal to be equally loving and supportive, noting that it is the best way to build a healthy and lasting relationship.,“When its one partner to show that they need the other more, or care more for the relationship to work, this gives room for toxic behaviour. For example, one party may take the other for granted and this can turn out to be emotionally abusive.”"

","If you’re celebrating Valentine’s Day, chances are you’re grown, yet here I am about to tell you how to spend this weekend! By the way, I know you guys can’t see me but I just did an epic celebratory ‘Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday this time’ dance. Not that I’m even remotely excited about the day itself, rather, the fact that being a Sunday and with curfews still on, not many people will venture out. For VD haters like myself, that’s great news as it means that should we venture out, we probably won’t run into smitten lovers all over the place and each other! That’s my hope anyway. I’ll miss the chocolate colleagues usually pass around though. And cake.,Someone save me a slice! I swear some bakeries make more on Valentine’s Day than the rest of the year! That may not be the case this year but I’m sure they’ll be alright. I was thinking though how great it would be if we switched things up. You know, do something nice for a stranger or someone you’re not romantically involved with or related to. If you chance upon those,‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers, get the item/s and give the extra one to someone at your workplace or anyone you know is single or just lost a loved one. You can also re-gift certain things. My mum wouldn’t approve this particular one as she believes it’s wrong and rude to give away or sell a present, but I think if you’re not using it and someone else needs it, why hang onto it? If money is not an issue, do something akin to what some newlyweds do by asking their guests to donate to their preferred charity in lieu of buying them gifts. And instead of buying that hideous red outfit for yourself, (told you I’m a hater!) buy masks and other protective equipment for frontline workers or someone who needs them in your neighbourhood.,Skip the romantic dinner for two since you have to be home by 7pm anyway and instead, buy some groceries for someone struggling. Kind of hard to sacrifice your outing or getaway, especially couples who’ve been stuck at home for months and could use a change of scenery to get their groove back but still, what’s more fulfilling than knowing you helped someone in need?"
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/lifestyle/making-friends-introvert,"Making friends as an introvert
","Introverts tend to avoid interacting or social dealings all together. Being the type that is reserved, such people never seek special attention and would rather keep to themselves.,But humans—introvert or not—are social beings that need relations with close friends and associates in one way or another. This is where it becomes challenging.,Jenn Granneman, the founder of Introvert Dear, quotes Laurie Helgoe, author of Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life Is Your Hidden Strength, comparing extroverts to hotels and introverts to luxury suites. Extroverts can accommodate a large number of interactions that come and go, while for introverts, bookings are limited.,She explains that when making friends, introverts are looking for friends who truly ‘get’ them. “The ultra-chatty extrovert who parties every weekend probably won’t be an introvert’s best friend. We are looking for people who understand our introversion, who can go deep, who run at our speed.”,Jose Uwamahoro a university student, says as an introvert, she understands that making friends is not easy mostly because introverted people rarely speak or form relationships for the sake of it.,They look for meaning, which means small talk is a no-go area for them, yet this is how people make new friends, she says. ,She considers it easy for such people to instead engage themselves in groups or events that interest them. These could be book clubs or movements for saving nature, such can be good to meet people with common interests.,Another way to form friendships, according to Enock Mutabazi, is practising socialising.  The best way to overcome a challenge is by facing it, he says. ,“If you want to make friends, you need to improve your ability to interact with others. The best way to do this is to try your level best to meet new people, and most importantly be willing to interact with them, even those you don’t know,” he says.,Granneman, on the other hand, is of the view that if you want to add some new faces to your inner circle, you don’t necessarily have to head to the nearest party or networking event. Chances are there are already people in your life who you would like to get to know better. Someone interesting, someone like-minded. So start by taking inventory of your acquaintances—that new person at work, a friendly neighbour, someone in your writers group whose work you admire. Identify one or two of these people to reach out to.,Granneman also encourages introverts to go ahead and make the first move.,Many introverts wait for others to come to them. Having survived our share of awkward interactions, we may worry about rejection. “What if I ask her to get coffee and she says no?” Or worse, “What if he gets to know me better and doesn’t like who I am?” The process of making new friends can fill anyone with self-doubt, even the most confident among us. And if you’re an introvert who has experienced significant rejection (as many of us have), you may feel like simply giving up, she writes.,Granneman also highlights the relevance of asking questions. Inevitably, when we meet new people, we have to do what every introvert dreads: talk about ourselves. Often, this is enough to stop a blossoming friendship in its tracks, she notes. However, she adds, the conversation doesn’t have to be all about you. Introverts have a superpower; listening. So get the other person talking by asking them questions: “What’s new in your life?” “What’s something you’ve learned recently?” “If you could have any career you wanted, what would it be? Why?”,Listening takes the spotlight off you, and most non-introverts love to talk about their favourite subject: themselves."

","February is the month of love and Valentine’s Day is just around the corner. Normally, people tend to go out of their way to express their love for each other, however, it might be different this year. ,With the current situation that still has restrictions on travel and social gathering, couples are faced with limited options on how they can celebrate. Nonetheless, this shouldn’t limit those who are looking forward to making the most of this day. Below are a few ‘date ideas’ that can help you enjoy this year’s Valentine’s Day with your significant other. ,Author Emily Swop commends the beauty of taking walks as a couple. This, she says, can be after dinner or hiking together. To her, this can change up your normal routine; you can take turns choosing which direction to go at each crossroad. While you’re at it, step off the sidewalk or road, and explore. Is there a pond or forest nearby that you have never ventured into? Use your photography skills, and take some creative photos together along the way, she writes.,A special home-cooked meal has always been much more romantic than eating out. If food is the way to your heart as a couple, then spending time in the kitchen preparing a meal together can be a great way to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Take turns cooking each other’s favourite dishes, and when you are done, wine and dine together, this will also help you create new memories for your relationship or marriage.,Tourism is still open for those who wish to spend time, for example, at a park or game reserve. Book early and plan on how you can make the best out of this time together. You can decide to spend a day or an entire weekend as you explore. And for more fun, you can even choose a destination that both of you have never been to, this will help you get out of your comfort zone and have a wonderful time together.,Have a good time with your mate by simply playing your favourite games as a couple. Therapists say playing games can help build stronger relationships. It takes the heat and stiffness out of a relationship. At times, as a couple you need to relax from the stress and daily obligations of making a relationship work and just have fun. On this Valentine’s Day, let it be the day you relax and spend this time together, just the two of you. Showing love and how much you care about your partner does not necessarily mean spending a lot of money on fancy dinners or flowers, at times spending time with them can be the best gift you can give them.,Taking a hike is a great way to unplug and unwind with your partner. This Valentine’s Day, choose a scenic spot where you and your partner can enjoy nature and have fun too. Hiking with a partner is also believed to be an incredibly rewarding activity done as a couple and that it can strengthen a relationship greatly as well.,A move night is always a great way of spending time together as a couple, especially if you are both movie lovers. And as it turns out, there are also advantages of watching movies together as a couple, for instance it can be a nice opener for a conversation. This Valentine’s, make your day memorable by simply selecting a few of your favourite movies and binge watch throughout the day. "

","At first, I thought it was a thing for overly spiritual people, then afterwards, I imagined it could be a personality thing, but then I realised that the paranoia of going public about happy moments, especially relationships before marriage, is real. And it got me really wondering, who started this and why? ,We know that Adam and Eve should be blamed for most pains that come to us in life; cramps, job hurdles, name it. But who should be blamed for the normalisation of hiding beautiful things?,Why can’t I casually post a happy picture of myself with le boyfriend without necessarily raising eyebrows?  Recently, Juju la Belle tweeted: “Here is a theory that I don’t understand about keeping your partner off social media until you’re engaged/ready for marriage. ‘What if they break up with you after that?’ …Live every happiness as it was the last. What if you die today? Make yourself happy. Only You.”,It’s not like we are planning on dying, really. We’re here for a long, good time but it is ridiculous to hold our breaths till the day we feel ‘safe’ about our little happy world. ,While I was celebrating my birthday two weeks ago at the coast (even the memory of it makes me smile so widely), I took a little video of my drink, the saxophone, and the blue waters bordered by beautiful white sand. Oh, the video had nice background music too (Sauti Sol). A few minutes later, my saxophone mouthpiece fell headfirst and got broken so I couldn’t continue with the ‘birthday concert’. ,About an hour later after I had even ‘moved on’, my friend saw my status and he jokingly said that someone saw the video and spat, sending the mouthpiece to an early grave. I laughed so hard at that. But apart from it being hilarious, he went ahead and explained that several people do not share their happy moments, not because they are introverted or private, but due to fear of enemies of progress. ,I found this fact so sad. That we have to hide our beautiful lives and success in a dark room and even put a padlock until they ‘mature’. Businesses aren’t hidden until they mature, though. The minute one starts rearing chicken, for instance, they immediately send the word out without necessarily thinking about the enemies of progress. Is the ‘spitting ideology’ only customised for relationships and pregnancies?,I know this could also come from a place of trauma, and I truly wish you complete healing if you were ever in a relationship with someone and things didn’t work out. I was too, LOL. Back when I was young and fun. Heck, we even exchanged names on Facebook. It was an East African affair if you ask me. ,Looking back, though, it was a silly, childish move but I would not say that I regret it because it gave me so much joy back then. You don’t need much to make a 20-year-old happy, really and besides, it was the trend back then so we were cool and sure did enjoy it while it lasted. ,I came to understand that if one posts a picture of a young relationship that hasn’t reached the engagement or wedding level yet, the responses they receive from their contacts include things like, ‘why are you posting him if you don’t know if he is the one for sure’ and ‘did you get engaged and didn’t tell us?’ Like no, Susan. I don’t know if he is ‘the one’ because they don’t come with an ear tag, like cows. But I would sure love to enjoy every step of the relationship my way. ,Who introduced this ‘hide it till you tie it’ policy? It sure does need to be revised."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/lifestyle/do-you-believe-valentines-day,"Do you believe in Valentine’s Day?
","February 14 will be Valentine’s Day. Also known as Saint Valentine’s Day, it is celebrated annually. Usually on this day, people surprise their loved ones with gifts, lunch and dinner dates, cards, flowers, among other things, as a gesture of love. ,asked a variety of people what their views on celebrating the day are.,Personally, I think a strong couple doesn’t need to celebrate Valentine’s Day to prove their love. Valentine’s Day has become a highly commercialised day of ‘forced love’. Quality love shouldn’t be celebrated on one day a year. Love can be expressed 365/366 days a year. What hurts is that commercials exaggerate it—they imply that if you don’t gift your lover on this day, you don’t love them, which isn’t true.,Yes, I do believe in celebrating Valentine’s Day. I know it’s a symbolic day to consider the love that we give daily and think about how to improve. This love isn’t only for relationships. It cuts across religion too.,Although every day is a day for us to celebrate our loved ones, just like a birthday or any other special day, I like to remind my wife how special she is to me. It gives us a chance to add ‘spice’ to our relationship, and I know how special the day is to her, so I do it to put a smile on her face. She does the same for me. So, if your significant other or loved one likes a little surprise on Valentine’s Day, just do it without over-thinking. The rewards of making them smile will be harvested with two hands.,I feel like it can be theorised. As we celebrate any religious holy day including Christmas, for the sake of giving value to a certain activity which might have either happened or been recognised on that day, yes, we then need to value what St. Valentine did. But again, this day seems to have lost the value we used to give it. Currently speaking, Valentine’s Day became more of a day for romantic couples to have fun, go out—more of a vacation day. On that note, I wouldn’t judge those who decide not to waste their time and money, and completely take it as any other day.,I don’t believe in celebrating a particular day for our loved ones, but I consider celebrating Valentine’s Day every day. This is because we must love every day and unconditionally. Thus, there is no special day to show your partner how grateful you are for their presence in your life, instead, every single day must be seen as an opportunity to celebrate love.,Business-wise, Valentine’s Day is the perfect day to raise sales, but family-wise, it is really pointless, because I believe that to people who truly love one another, every day is Valentine’s Day.,Much as I don’t mind the celebrations, they are not a big deal to me because one thing I do believe in is the daily celebration of love. I love surprises and if my boyfriend or any person I love surprises me, or not, I will still love them as much as I have always.,We have different opinions about Valentine’s ,Day but it doesn’t really matter whom you choose to celebrate it with. Or if you choose not to celebrate. It all comes down to one’s choice or belief. Though it’s a day to show affection to the ones we care about.  It could be a partner, friend, parent, or any other family member, a workmate, not forgetting yourself. This can be the day people reconcile with one another. Letting go of the past and what hurt them. It also brings out a clear picture of what love is about and caring for one another.,If I am surprised with gifts on any day, it still means as much on Valentine’s Day. The acts on Valentine’s Day should be done on other days too. I won’t feel bad if my boyfriend fails to do something special on Valentine’s Day because I know he has proved that he loves and cares about me and our relationship in many ways. Not making it a special day doesn’t make him half a man. He remains the same man that melted my heart years back. "

","During the occasion of the National Prayer Breakfast, the Head of State challenged leaders to double their efforts in delivery so that the country can recover from the slump caused by the coronavirus outbreak.,According to the President, a lot has been lost in the past one year as the country instituted measures to curtail the devastation from the virus that has ravaged global order.,While the worst of the devastation may have been avoided owing to the robust measures that were rolled out in the early stages of the pandemic, the economy has greatly been affected.,The national economy contracted considerably, many people lost their jobs, while businesses have closed.,Available statistics show that up to 7,401 jobs have been lost in agro-processing, 13,000 in mining, and 2,644 in energy among many sectors.,Industries like hospitality are still limping, while others have begun to take off.,However, the worst consequences of pandemic – big human loss - has potentially been avoided, while the vaccines which are already being distributed allows the country to look forward to a future without Covid-19 and to rebuilding the economy.,Already in Rwanda, nearly 350,000 people from the most exposed groups – frontline workers, people working in security, those with underlying conditions, and people of advanced age among others – have received their first shots and the second ones are on their way.,Through different channels, government is looking to continue procuring vaccines and the target is to inoculate 30 per cent of the population at the end of 2021 and double that by June 2022.,With such effort to keep the virus at bay, the remaining wall to scale is reviving the economy from the devastation it has been plunged in.,Already, multiple interventions have been deployed, like the Economic Recovery Fund in which the government looks at sinking Rwf350 billion to help accelerate the recovery of businesses most affected by Covid-19.,Just recently, another intervention was launched – the Manufacture and Build to Recover Programme – which seeks to extend tax breaks and tax credits to businesses with an aim to reduce cost of investment for new manufacturers as well as those seeking to expand existing operations.,All these interventions seeks to buttress Rwandans against the shocks of Covid-19 but it will require hard work from everyone – both in public and private sector – to ensure these interventions yield the desired results and eventually put back our economy on good footing."

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/motsepe-could-be-long-awaited-head-turn-around-africas-game,"Motsepe could be long-awaited head to turn around Africa’s game
","The election of Dr Patrice Motsepe to head the Confederation of African Football likely marks the moment the continent has long been waiting for to turn around its game.,The South African billionaire is well regarded. He is not only an astute businessman but has earned his credentials with how he turned his club Mamelodi Sundowns from failure after he purchased it in 2004 to win the CAF Champions League in 2016.,The club is now the most powerful in South Africa with seven league titles to its name. This marks Motsepe as a man who knows his game and the passion it must take to succeed.,And he is not shy to say it: “I will not be the president of an organization which, in 4 years, will not have made significant, tangible, practical and accessible progress. It will not happen,” he was emphatic during a press conference after taking CAF leadership.,He takes over from Madagascan Ahmad Ahmad’s troubled rein that was plagued with accusations of corruption, nepotism and financial mismanagement. A PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ report had found CAF’s financial record as “unreliable and not trustworthy.”,The report points to an issue of governance, something Motsepe will have to urgently deal with. His 10-point manifesto anticipates this, along with issues such as ensuring competent refereeing and entrenching Video Assistant Referees (VAR).,Crucially, though, much will depend on sponsorships and strategic partnerships, which the manifesto also anticipates.,The issue of TV blackout of CAF games has particularly been galling these past couple of years. The termination of the $1 billion television and marketing rights deal with France-based company Lagardère Sport in November 2019 resulted in the blackout through SuperSport—the continent’s largest sports broadcaster.,It is not to put too fine a point to emphasise the disappointment, and that any TV deals should guarantee CAF income in all competitions— the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, World Cup qualifiers and club competitions— are on TV. The new president is well seized by this.,But there is the pending matter of the Cup of Nations, the continent's flagship event, whether there are plans to limit its frequency.,Asked about it, he was categorical: ""Total Afcon at present must take place every two years,"" he assured. He however qualified this saying the matter was not closed to a discussion with partners.,The idea was first raised last year in proposals by FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, to reduce the number Afcon is held from once every two years to once every four years.,Predictably, the proposal raised some uproar, the tournament being Africa’s most prized competition. The more frequently it is held, the more it might generate much-needed cash.,But some of FIFA’s proposals including initiatives such as to develop and grow women and youth football are reflected in Motsepe’s 10-point plan.,This can only be a good thing, as the future of African football lies in the youth while it can only enhance the women’s game if they are better included.,The larger picture is about higher ideals. To quote him, “Football is a powerful tool to reassert the pride, the dignity, the global respect of Africans, and Africa can produce and compete at the highest level in the world, both at the World Cup as well as the FIFA club championships.”,Despite grumbles that FIFA might be interfering a bit too much in CAF compared to, say, Europe or South America, one cannot fault the role the global body must continue to play if the continent must realise all the game has to offer. Recall that FIFA is composed of member association such as CAF from all regions in the world.,Motsepe’s election brings some welcome change in terms of inclusion. For the first time in its 64-year history, CAF has an Anglophone president.,And, in addition to increasing the number of vice presidents to better serve the continent, they now include a woman bringing to five from three vice presidents previously."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/covid-19-impact-should-accelerate-need-common-standards-ngos,"Covid-19 impact should accelerate the need for common standards of NGOs
","Nonprofit Organisations (NPO) or what is mostly referred to as NGOs are defined differently in various jurisdictions and sometimes expectations of their several stakeholders diverge.,For example, here in Rwanda, an international NGOs is an organisation that is established in accordance with foreign laws and whose objective relates to serving in the public interest.,Similarly, the role of such an NGO be it local or international should supplement the government to initiate and or implement new solutions with an aim of dealing with diverse problems across all sectors of the country such as health, economic sector, education, peacebuilding, environmental protection, services among many others.,While in Rwanda such organisations are regulated, merely this activity revolves around registering and the granting of legal personality whilst monitoring their service delivery including compliance with the laws among other regulatory roles - similar to most other jurisdictions in Africa; the subjectivity to a specific financial reporting requirements/guidance appears nonexistent.,Lack of a common financial reporting standard therefore instigates numerous issues including the confusion it creates for even auditors to determine “a true and fair view” without an applicable framework to compare with.,Other concerns may include inconsistent financial reports; high costs resulting from a need to prepare different reports for different stakeholders; reduced transparency – due to lack of clarity and consistency; and the perceived enhanced double funding fraud.,The International Financial Reporting for Non-Profit Organisations (IFR4NPO) project is developing a guidance regarding the development of an internationally applicable guidance for how NPOs prepare their annual financial statements, which can be adopted by any country if they choose to.,I am sure that this would be a great initiative for local and international NPOs operating in Rwanda to adopt this guidance once ready, similar to what their counterparts in both the private and public sector have done – adopting and implementing IFRS and IPSAS respectively.,But just before either adapting or adopting the guidance, all stakeholders including NPOs themselves, funders, regulators and auditors should participate in this process especially at the consultation level to ensure that the cultural context is well reflected whilst providing an opportunity to everyone to shape the future – each stakeholder’s voice and perspectives are fundamental in the development process.,To cite just a few examples emanating from Covid-19 impact, several NPOs appear to lack sustainability including limited emergency funds to deal with the current as well as the uncertain effects of the pandemic.,While this may appear cross-cutting to several organisations; at least in the counterpart sector, there has been an emergency fund to cater for businesses that have been strongly hit - which is a different case when it comes to the NPO sector.,Since this sector largely depends on aid and grants to finance their operations, it may not be easy for them to survive as it may require that they explore ways of obtaining new funding opportunities.,This could be a dilemma in itself when the funder has also been affected by the pandemic unless if there are, for example protective measures for may be local NGOs to be funded directly by either the government or any other donor to directly deal with mitigating the impact of Covid-19 to the citizenry.,Effective survival therefore would require, among other initiatives, heightened collaboration with the government and other funders – be it within the country, regionally and beyond; proper accountability and transparency – as a result of well-prepared financial statements that are more transparent, more credible and easier to prepare; well-developed risk assessment strategies including response actions.,It therefore becomes paramount that a common international reporting standard similar to what we already have for the private sector – International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the public sector – International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) is developed for the NPO sector - bidding at contributing towards the creation of a more resilient and accountable sector able to attract, generate and utilize funds to achieve positive social good.,It is important to note that there is currently no common international accounting standard for non-profit organizations (NPOs) globally - it is only a few funding organizations that have tried to develop their own reporting requirements; other NPOs financial reports are often prepared under private sector, public sector or a mixture of both standards.,Developing and implementing a common Guidance will greatly contribute to enhanced accountability and decision making beneficial to all stakeholders including donors and governments where such NPOs operate. Other objectives of the Project also include the addressing of specific NPO issues to promote comparability of NPO financial reports and improving the quality, transparency and credibility of NPO financial reports. Preparing accrual based financial reports could be one of the quicker means for additional funding due to heightened trust and confidence of the NPO activities.,More so, the other important outcome from this Project that has never existed before, is an establishment of a global community of stakeholders able to engage and collaborate to solve sector-wide issues; For NPOs applying the Guidance, it means they will be better able to demonstrate their capacity and attract funds, as well as supporting the provision of decision useful information for governance and management. ,For funders it contributes to better and more efficient due diligence, which is a win for NPOs too.  And having clear guidance simplifies and improves the value of audit assurance.,Ultimately, it is believed that the Guidance will contribute to a more resilient and accountable sector that is better able to attract, generate and utilize funds to achieve positive social good.,Please do your part by contributing to the Consultation Paper as the initial step in developing a common Guidance for NPOs by visiting ,.,."

really is
","Everyone, even sceptics and optimists, agree that these are truly hard times. All recognise the disruption of practically all aspects of life and the uncertainty about when things will return to normal. What’s perhaps different is how people respond to the times.,We humans are generally a complaining lot whatever the circumstances. In good times and bad we will go on about things not going quite right and blame everyone else but themselves.,Hard times bring out these dissatisfactions in stark relief, even those that appear unconnected to the moment. Most people will complain more than usual but do little more. It is human nature, I suppose, or at any rate that’s what we say.,A few, however, gird themselves to confront the difficult times and try to get the better of them. These, we say, are exceptional as if to say that what they have done is not expected of them or is not human nature. That also is, well, human nature.,Given a choice, some of those complaining would rather live elsewhere than their countries. That’s the impression one gets from comments in the media and other public utterances in the region, often amplified or originated by foreign media.,Most of the dissatisfaction is with leaders and governments. You hear this, for instance, the leaders are selfish and uncaring, except for their families and friends. They even take the Covid-19 vaccine in secret while the rest are left to cope as best they can.,Or they bemoan the ramshackle or non-existent public social infrastructure, especially health and education, and say it is no wonder it’s like that because the leaders have no need for it. They go to private hospitals or travel abroad for medical needs.,They raise the alarm about their leaders looting of national wealth. Or foreigners doing so. Often, both in collusion.,Their systems don’t work or they are opaque and inefficient. They complain of information blackouts that keep citizens in the dark about so many issues.,These complaints and more have been loudest in these Covid-19 times. Of course all the things being grumbled about are not new. They have been there, in the open or under the surface unseen because, well, they were covered. Now Covid-19 has removed the lid in more senses than one.,And so, some of the citizens of these countries where dissatisfaction is strongest would probably want away if they had the option.,Not so some of us. We would not exchange this little paradise (admittedly still in the making) for anywhere else. If I were ever asked where I would want to live in times like these, the answer would be quick and simple. In a place that assures me of my safety, provides certainty, where matters are predictable, where I would not be shocked or surprised by every happening. That place is Rwanda.,I have seen or heard of fewer places where they recognise any threat immediately and quickly take appropriate action to protect citizens and foreigners on its soil. The measures may sometimes be very tough and painful but we stick to them because they have been explained.,We may be asked to make sacrifices, forgo some pleasures, even rights, but we do so willingly because we know it is all in the common interest, the collective safety of all. They are not demands based on someone’s whims or the caprices of another.,Of course, there will always be some who grumble. That’s to be expected. It would be an unfamiliar world without grumblers. You might say again it is also part of human nature.,Only in few places would everything possible be done to mitigate the effects of the painful measures. These actions extend to animals, especially those genetically closest to us.,I am sure you would also want to live in a place, where when remedies to such threats as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic become available, it is among the first to get and use them. The moment vaccines were obtained this country was able to immediately inoculate people of all classes and nationalities on Rwandan soil, even prison inmates, including those that have visited terror on the land. Where else have you heard that happen?,All of which make me wonder: with all these people-inspired actions, where do some people find all those horrible things they say and write about our country and leaders? If I knew how I would curse them so that the words would dry in their throats and become stiff on their fingers. But I don’t and can only urge them to open their eyes and hearts and see what there is.,Whether they see the light or not, we are happy to live in a country that is always ready to respond to any circumstances in order to keep its people safe.    "

","Agriculture matters. It’s the biggest employer in Sub-Saharan Africa, and a more effective way to lift people out of poverty is yet to emerge. But amongst economic sectors, agriculture is the most significant water user and the ,.,As natural forests give way for agriculture and other types of development, the Earth ,.,Inevitably, it is left vulnerable to climate change, desertification, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of other problems.,In such scenarios where people’s livelihoods compete with nature itself, the benefits that trees provide can be best sustained by integrating their growth into agriculturally-productive landscapes. Agroforestry – which entails growing trees among or around food crops – is a proven method for farmers to grow more diverse, productive, and profitable crops while protecting the environment by reducing farmers’ reliance on forests. And as climate variability increases, farm families need assets to cope with shocks and make productive investments to uplift their living standards. ,Agroforestry attempts to balance several needs: to grow a diverse, adequate supply of food both that can meet national and global demands and satisfy the needs of the producers themselves; to grow trees for food, timber, and other commercial purposes; and to protect the natural environment to ensure it continues to provide resources to meet the needs of present and future generations.,Along with its farm and landscape-level environmental benefits, tree-planting is the most important non-crop asset for livelihoods for the world’s rural poor. Over the last decade, One Acre Fund, the agricultural non-profit I work with, collaborated with more than 990,000 farmers in nine countries to plant 40 million trees.,These include fruit trees, such as avocado, which constitute an important part of farming in Rwanda. Our research has shown that a small Rwf1,800 investment in tree seedlings can return 40 times as much – about Rwf73,805 – after 10 years when a mature timber tree is harvested. But despite increased interest globally in forestry, most large-scale efforts often bypass smallholders to focus on commercial plantations.,While many farmers know how to farm with trees and understand the benefits of agroforestry, more often than not, intended interventions fail to account for the social context and values, limiting their adoption and uptake. For example, some farmers are reluctant to plant trees because they associate trees with forests, not agriculture. Others fear that trees will out-compete crops for nutrients when grown together. How then can we encourage agroforestry amongst farming communities to promote tree planting interventions within agriculture?,My organization is championing the planting of one billion trees in farmlands across Sub-Saharan Africa. Using knowledge obtained through years of research, proven agroforestry systems, and practices, One Acre Fund is driving one of the biggest agroforestry efforts for smallholder farmers in six countries, where we aim to plant 250 million trees cumulatively by 2024 and one billion trees by 2030. In doing so, we will not only be responding to climatic needs but also project to generate more than $130.6 million in farmer revenue in 2024 alone.,In our experience, successful tree planting initiatives depend on the soil, farm context, and farmers’ goals. From the type of tree to plant, where to plant it, and attendant benefits, our tree projects are supported by rigorous research that ensures both farmers and the environment benefit. To ensure consistent results across the board, and to secure the benefits of trees for as many farmers as possible, we regularly partner with the government and the private sector in all our countries of operation.,From our research, adoption requires consistent communication – drawing success stories that illustrate how others use agroforestry, and fostering personal communication between farmers to learn from one another. What is more, peer-to-peer influence can change attitudes towards agroforestry. When farmers see their neighbours’ success, they are more likely to adopt agroforestry. And with time, their perception of the values of trees in agriculture can change.,In the longer-term, even though the decision on what to grow is up to individual farmers, their choices are influenced by the decisions and beliefs of entities such as local authorities and leadership, and community-based organizations. These powerful local actors can play key roles in the adoption of agroforestry programs that partner with community institutions, like farmer groups, to significantly increase the success of agroforestry efforts.,Lastly, government support plays a vital role in facilitating the uptake of agroforestry knowledge and practice. This is especially true for the policy and institutional context within which agroforestry is practiced. Specifically, governments can help revise outdated texts in terms of forestry and environmental legislation, improve tree crop value chains, provide technical support for the diversification of farming practices, and stronger coordination and cross-sectoral integration between agriculture, environmental, rural development, and business initiatives."

","The moment “The Bulldozer” – Magufuli’s nickname for his hard work – became president, he hit the ground, burrowed into its leadership mire and twisted up everything like a tropical cyclone.,The accepted laid-back way of working, absenteeism, ghost-salary-earning, sloth, the canker of corruption and embezzlement, plus other vices, ‘The Bulldozer/Cyclone’ sent them all into a spiralling pointed-rock that hung over Tanzania like a giant sword.,The perform-or-perish tremor touched off was felt within the country as it was, without.,Cynics in Africa and beyond dismissed his ways as a lot of bombast and blaster.,They’d seen it with the likes of Uganda’s Idi Amin and some initially credible revolutionaries, especially with a military background, who promised fundamental changes that would birth a better future, only for their momentum to peter out and many times sink their rule into worse rot.,However, optimists who believe in the eventual rise of Africa rejoiced in the arrival on the scene of a man marked by a sense of urgency in the service of his people. It was refreshing to have a man committed to positive action far removed from the sort who hunger for foreign favours at the expense of national, regional and continental progress.,These are the sort that work solely for self-preservation where their people’s strife festers under their noses. Be they inter-tribal, regional, religious infightings or poverty, disease and squalor, these quislings are too busy licking foreigners’ boots to address them.,In Africa that’s peppered with such self-seeking leaderships, Magufuli was a breath of fresh air.,With his avowed “Hapa Kazi Tu!” that’d be transliterated to “Men/Women At Work Here!”, he buried himself into his task with the impatience of a man who had for long borne testimony to leaderships that did not apply themselves to their fullest potential.,His country needed to move. And fast. Magufuli, the veritable workhorse, stepped on the gas.,He oversaw the retrenchment of civil servants with fake papers, the removal from the payroll of thousands of ghost workers, prompt salary payment to public service workers, the clearance of old-file caseloads in courts and the reduction in the incidence of graft. He saw to it that Tanzanians enjoyed permanent sovereignty over their country’s natural resources.,Education in primary and secondary schools was provided free. Electricity saw great expansion as did access to clean water. To the existing number of healthcare facilities were added over one thousand more.,The economy saw inflation contained while the tax collection base was pushed up and debt levels pulled down. Industrial production was intensified and exports rose. From a crawl, the country raced and achieved lower middle income status.,The existing road network has increased many times over and the ports of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara have been enlarged to handle more load capacity.,With Magufuli, Tanzanians have certainly made many developmental achievements and there are still many projects that, when completed, will be of great benefit to the country and the region. Among these projects is the Standard Gauge Railway whose completion Rwandans eagerly await.,Of course, ‘The Bulldozer’ had a very big Achilles’ heel. He never realised that Tanzania could not live in a silo. That it had to actively engage the continent and the world, if for nothing else, to assert the continent’s dignity for equal partnership with other continents.,Denying the existence of Covid-19 and dismissing it as a cruel creation of the West that could vanish in the face of crude indigenous potions was surely a fatal mistake. When all global communities were crying “Devastation!” trying to attain progress without addressing it was an effort in futility.,All Magufuli needed was to effect citizen-centred leadership where he’d be guided as he’d guide, to avert the above ills. With his ears connected to Tanzanians of all categories, he could also have found a way of accommodating opposition politicians and critical media personalities.,As if the Rwanda I am talking from does not share the same Western flak in that area, I can hear some of you sneer! However, there is a difference in where the two countries are coming from.,Show me a Rwandan oppositionist politician or critical journalist who differed with the government on policy and I’ll show you a man or woman who was drafted into government or enjoys all media freedoms. Otherwise peddling retrogressive divisionism tactics, genocide ideology or resorting to terror acts are all in contravention of the laws of this land.,Tanzania, having enjoyed a history of relative peace this far, is not victim to such criminal poseurs.,But we are celebrating the life of a man who pushed Tanzania to remarkable heights of progress within the short span of five years. As he took us all by pleasant surprise at every turn, how many surprises would he have sprung if the Almighty he believed in had allowed him to serve his term?,As President Samia Suluhu Hassan steps into his giant shoes, she’ll do well to consult an equally hard-work-focused tiny neighbour to her country’s north-west, as did Magufuli."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/rras-effort-impose-mandatory-ebm-invoices-now-affects-all-businesses,"RRA’s effort to impose mandatory EBM invoices now affects all businesses
","A recent announcement from the Commissioner-General (CG) of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) impacts businesses and other entities claiming tax deductions associated with expenses.,From 1 January 2021 onwards, certain non-VAT registered taxpayers must provide invoices/receipts generated by an Electronic Invoicing System (EIS) - commonly known as EBM - as documentation to support their tax deduction claims.,Although there are a number of challenges with implementing this directive, overall the CG’s announcement should serve RRA’s objective of broadening the uptake of EISs. Since 2013, EISs have helped VAT-registered taxpayers in Rwanda to improve bookkeeping and Value Added Tax (VAT) compliance.,All VAT-registered businesses must provide customers with a certified VAT receipt and as of this writing, approximately 95% of all VAT registered suppliers have an EIS to generate these receipts.,RRA is currently developing a number of software solutions to improve the accessibility, convenience and accuracy of EIS processes. The new EIS applications will be mobile accessible and provide web-based invoicing and online integration with taxpayers’ invoicing systems.,RRA plans to get to the point where audit and tax collections would rely substantially on data analytics derived from EIS data. Going forward, we are likely to see more ‘benchmark audits’ establishing taxpayers’ true sales patterns, using data analytics to flag taxpayers deviating from this pattern and potentially triggering automatic ‘mystery shopper’ audits to verify non-compliance among taxpayers.,Certainly RRA has a tall order of expectations to meet. Modernizing RRA service delivery, broadening the tax base, enforcing tax compliance and supporting development through effective, data-driven tax revenue collection are not idle concerns. Even so, the CG’s announcement requires clarification in a number of areas and, through a process of public engagement, these clarifications have already helped to address some sticky issues.,One challenge associated with extending the scope of EIS to corporate income tax is that not all expenses are supportable by invoices. RRA has clarified by indicating that certain expenses which can be validated through other means, such as payroll costs indicated by PAYE declarations and imported service costs indicated by withholding tax declarations, may qualify for deduction without EIS receipts. Costs associated with the transport of imported goods should be supported by invoices which can be stamped and validated by customs officials, even if the transporters themselves do not issue EIS receipts.,Recently, the CG has issued a series of industry-specific announcements that intend to clarify, streamline and support tax compliance for taxpayers operating in the construction and agriculture sectors. In agriculture, RRA has acknowledged that non-commercial and non-registered small-hold farmers may supply cooperatives, traders or processing factories without issuing EIS invoices/receipts, whereas their trading partners can still benefit from taxable income deductions provided that they keep detailed records of transactions with these farmers. Additionally, a new category of supplies (category D) in EIS software has been introduced which would apply to certain small- and medium-sized entities as non-VAT registered taxpayers and enable them to issue EIS invoices without having to register for VAT.,RRA is likely to continue issuing additional announcements and updates as needed. One sector that would benefit from urgent clarification is the NGO sector. Most NGOs are not in commercial trading and therefore don’t have or need EIS, but RRA could validate the sponsorships/donations received by NGOs through the annual financial statements that they submit and therefore not require them to issue EIS receipts to donors/sponsors.,Another challenge is of a legal nature. Whereas Rwanda’s Tax Procedures Law requires persons who carry out taxable activities to issue invoices generated by EIS, the deductibility of expenses is actually governed by the Income Tax Law. The Income Tax Law only requires taxpayers to substantiate their purchases/expenses with proper purchase receipts - not necessarily EIS invoices. RRA may face legal disputes if they intend to implement CG announcements as law.,In our view, RRA should reinforce the importance of EIS invoices but allow a certain degree of flexibility when auditing taxpayers’ expenses. Whereas EIS invoices should be the , evidence a taxpayer should present as proof of purchase, RRA should be flexible enough to accept other forms of supporting documents if EIS invoices are not available, provided that RRA can validate that the cost was actually incurred and income declared by the other party. The possession of EIS invoices should not be an end in and of itself!"

Old friends and family outside Africa wondered why I would give up a comfortable life in Austin, Texas to move half-way across the world without a house or job to go to. And new friends and contacts here in Rwanda and East Africa wondered why I would choose to live in Kigali?,I heard many versions of the same joke: “You go to Nairobi to do business. You go to Kampala to party and have fun. And you come to Kigali to go to sleep.”,Yes, Kigali is certainly a lot more sedate than my former home cities of Hong Kong, London, Milan and New York but I have really enjoyed the relative peace, quiet, safety and lack of stress here over the last two years. My Kinyarwanda teacher Denyse tells me, “There is no need for “comfort food” here in Rwanda. All food is good and appreciated.”,After the first year of getting familiar with my new surroundings and learning the ropes, this last year of Corona-enforced solitude in my Kimihurura home has allowed me the cherished time to do a lot more self-refection, career/life prioritization and both professional and creative writing.,It has been very tough at times not hugging and having breakfast tacos with my grown daughter Emma in Texas and not being with close friends, particularly those who have been sick or suffering loss or heartache. But thanks to relatively reliable Wifi, WhatsApp and Zoom have afforded some level of virtual closeness with Emma and with many other friends, colleagues and even clients whom I would probably not have been in such close contact with otherwise.,I even did an animal communication course via Zoom, which came in handy when I inadvertently poisoned my Texan cat Coco last Summer and when one of my adopted street dogs Scout escaped recently. They are both fine now.,As more and more people get vaccinated – including me, hopefully – I know that this period of relative seclusion and tranquility is going to end for both good and maybe not so good.,On the positive side, there will be family reunions and social celebrations again. Some local friends here in Kigali will finally be able to get married properly and I will be able to visit my daughter in Texas in June. And renewed mobility will provide a much-needed remedy for growing “Zoom Fatigue”. One client at a large global foundation just told me that she had 57 web calls last week!,Unfortunately, there will also be pressure to get back into the “busyness” of a return to more “normal” working life, with a barrage of daily, consecutive work meetings, which will now be face-to-face as well as on Zoom; renewed commutes and longer days in the office; irascible bosses and staff gossip; and crowded airports and cramped airplanes.,Hopefully, we can all find a way to retain the good that has emerged during the last year of Covid challenges and restrictions and to avoid repeating old mistakes and unhealthy patterns of behaviour.,The “Three Ms” of Mindfulness, Meditation (or prayer) and Mentoring can help us all to keep up grounded, centered and on track, both personally and professionally. And regular exercise, balanced diet and enough sleep will help too.,And I will continue my search for definitive answers to the following questions about living in Kigali:,1.     Why does Kinyarwanda have 10 classes of nouns and at least nine ways of saying the number Six - ,?,2.     Why do people not use the beautifully groomed public parks for picnics or even just jogging or walking their dogs?,3.     Why do people pass you on the right in their cars in the road but on the left when walking on the pavement/sidewalk?,4.     Why do some taxis have steering wheels on the right and why do many taxi drivers not carry any change at all for a RWF 5,000 note?,5.     Why are there somewhat scary, tall, thin, white grimacing mannequins outside clothing stores?,6.     Why can you usually get dry wine in a restaurant but not always sweet wine?,7.     Why do Rwandans love cows and milk but not see protein-filled yoghurt as a healthy lunch or produce and consume different kinds of cheese (such as fresh Parmesan, which I will begin asking visitors to bring again)?"

","Training the future’s health workforce within rural, poor, or vulnerable settings is a sustainable means of addressing global health inequities. Students acquire an understanding and ability to analyse the unique bio-social health challenges faced by marginalized groups, and are therefore better positioned to provide tailored, contextualized care for those most vulnerable. ,Yet while this need evidently exists, too few future health professionals stay within low-resourced settings where the need is greatest, swept up instead in the, of students to train in cities where they will likely be better compensated, and have greater access to resources.,The problem of ‘,’ hangs on two issues: there are too few quality institutions within rural settings, and those that do exist, lack sufficient infrastructure and facilities to compete with the education offered in urban institutions. ,Lack of funding (both upfront and long-term investment) coupled with a lack of properly trained project managers in these areas has resulted in , in rural health institutions, which severely caps the learning opportunities these institutions can provide.,Without funding, many rural institutions will be unable to procure even the most basic equipment, laboratory and classroom space, and online learning capacity systems, the latter which has been critical to the survival of these organisations during Covid-19.,Beyond procurement, without qualified project managers you cannot implement them in a structured and phased way to ensure future sustainability. ,Whilst Covid-19 has resulted in large-scale investment towards healthcare and education infrastructure in urban areas such as,in central London and, in Boston Massachusetts, many rural healthcare and health education facilities including hospitals, health centres, health posts, and medical schools have been left behind.,This lack of funding stems from low tax or revenue base for raising domestic funds, low prioritisation of health in public sector resource allocation, spending inefficiencies, and the widespread misconception that quality medical and learning facilities can only exist and be properly implemented within urban settings.,Public and private institutions, governments and funding organizations need to recognize that by bolstering the institutional infrastructure in rural areas, they create robust foundations to,for all.,The University of Global Health Equity (,), a global health sciences university in the rural north of Rwanda, is proof of this. It’s students benefit from unparalleled learning opportunities within a state-of-the-art campus, whilst also in close proximity to the communities they will go on to serve.,UGHE’s well-equipped science laboratories facilitate anatomy dissection and basic and clinical sciences education, and a sophisticated campus simulation center offers students extensive practice with realistic patient care scenarios.,Classrooms are equipped with modern teleconferencing capabilities to facilitate remote instruction, such as the ability to host virtual anatomy lessons between two continents.,Infrastructure considerations should not stop at practical facilities, though of course these are critical. At UGHE, the strategic planning process extends to making its campus green and environmentally sound, in the knowledge that a conducive learning environment is an important part of student study.,The students and those that serve them - faculty, staff, and campus contractors - study and operate in a deliberately green space, surrounded by trees, butterfly gardens, fish ponds, and the 13.5ft Muhabura volcano in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National park. ,This same principle applies to health facilities such as hospitals and health centers: a green and, is conducive to the provision of high quality medical care and better patient and health worker mental wellbeing.,Across the valley from UGHE’s Campus, , was designed and built to provide high quality medical care and a patient-centered experience. Green energy and infection control features are also among the major guiding forces to its expansion plans that will see it accredited as a teaching hospital for Rwanda's public and private medical schools. ,With Covid-19 putting intense pressure on health care and education institutional systems,  health sectors and health education institutions should embrace , and adaptations to maintain vital services amidst a crisis and efficiently respond to the changing institutional requirements.,Adaptations include transitioning to virtual teaching, and revised campus operational policies and protocols to meet hygiene and social distancing measures. Agility is key to rapid response, supported by the collaboration, task shifting and clear communications between institutional staff who themselves can serve as,Health care and health educational institutional leaders will also need to determine the facilities maintenance approaches and systems that are pertinent to their institutional architecture, engineering and location to accommodate future growth.,UGHE’s Butaro Campus was uniquely built using locally sourced materials for building and a 90% local construction workforce, making maintenance easy, and simultaneously driving socio-economic impact in the surrounding communities.,A mobile-first facility management system, was also acquired to manage the University wide infrastructure. The system allows quick interaction among and between the campus maintenance team and all campus occupants irrespective of where they are.,The campus was also already designed to accommodate crises like Covid-19; private student and staff housing supports social distancing, and pre-existing learning management platforms facilitates virtual teaching. ,The ever-evolving Covid-19 measures warrant agile, adaptable systems and strong facilities management teams to maintain quality health and education services for all. The location of health care and health education facilities should not determine the quality of healthcare and health education facilities located in rural areas.,High quality medical care and education can be, and should be delivered in state-of-the-art facilities in rural areas, to ensure that the health professionals trained are qualified, responsive, and equitable in their approach to delivering care to the communities that need it most."

The increment applied across different quantities and has been gradual, according to consumers.,Other reasons such as high demand driven by the wintertime in western countries that experienced this type of weather conditions have been advanced. ,Naturally, for every layer created, the individual involved wants to make a profit and push the burden down the supply chain. The eventual victim is the end-user.,This is the most plausible explanation for the hike because, the world has over the years been going through similar weather cycles but the spike in gas prices had remained relatively stable previously.,What is happening instead is that as many people embrace gas as a source of energy, mainly due to the vigorous campaign by government aimed at curbing use of wood fuel for cooking, demand has been created.,Subsequently, increased demand has led to an increase in the number of players in the market, hence the multiple layers of supply.,The bad news is, things are getting out of hand, and many families are now increasingly finding cooking gas out of reach.,Some are saying they will be forced to go back to using charcoal or firewood, which will only set us back on the gains made in restoring our forests and expose us further to more brutal effects of climate change.,Already climate change is biting. Just last week, Rwanda Metrological Agency announced that weather patterns had changed in the past couple of years, with the country now experiencing both extremes of the dry and rainy seasons.,All this was attributed to climate change.,Returning to charcoal burning and firewood will only lead to more decimation of our forests and exposing us further to more brutal climate change effects.,Government should therefore do two things; regulate prices for gas which will discourage the unscrupulous distributors, and, where necessary, subsidise the commodity to make it affordable for more families."

For once, we were going to be part of everyone.,And come April last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) must have celebrated, too. COVAX as the platform that would ensure equal access for everyone was here.,“Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and us”, cooed WHO, COVAX would ensure participating countries get vaccines. Governments, global health organisations, manufacturers, scientists, private sector, civil society, philanthropy, COVAX attracted their contributions all.,It would literally be a lifeline for every earthling. For it was true: “COVAX was the only global solution to this pandemic.”,Its aim was to have two billion doses available initially so that, in case of rich countries going for bilateral deals and swallowing up vaccines like kids swallow up candy, there’d be enough for also low-income economies. 5% would be put aside for those under nobody’s care, like refugees.,After all, as far as Covid-19 is concerned, no one is safe until everyone is safe.,It made sense to all economies.,Until the first vaccines were approved and all hell broke loose! The “in-case-of-rich-countries going-for-bilateral-deals……..” chickens had come home to roost.,It was a scene direct out of Capitol Hill, when frenzied Trump fanatics stormed The Capitol.,The grabbing and hoarding reminded you of the 2011 England/London riots that followed the shooting dead of Mark Duggan at the hands of police. Remember how looters braved shootings that saw five more deaths and arson to break into and ransack shops?,It was a madness that shook the UK and shocked us all.,You may also remember the 2016 Louisiana (USA) flooding. The dangerous floods that drowned or swept away whole buildings and occupants were not deterrent enough for looters. Nor was the fact of some of their own being swept away in looted vehicles laden to their racks with loot.,It was bad enough seeing such mayhems that involved citizens in parts of these advanced societies, but seeing their governments also engage in similar barbarity? In this 21st century, surely!,You’d have thought that their past destructions of innocent societies to their south, east and west would have injected some remorse in their hearts. And maybe taught them the virtue of living in gainful, mutual symbiosis.,Gullible us, we never remembered the old adage: “A leopard never changes its spots”.,So, whole governments descended on vaccine manufacturers to grab and hoard more than their citizens needed, some having paid way before the vaccines were manufactured, let alone approved, and to hell with the rest of the world!,In fact, we watched in stupefaction as wrangles broke out amongst them, as they accused one another of keeping vaccines to themselves and denying them others.

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/everyone-should-choosetochallenge-gender-stereotypes-and-gender-bias,"Everyone should #ChooseToChallenge gender stereotypes and gender bias
","This year’s theme for International Women’s Day, “Choose to Challenge”, encourages everyone to call out gender bias and inequality, hailing the notion that from challenge comes change and that change leads to transformation. Even though it will take years to attain gender equality, it is everyone’s responsibility to challenge gender stereotypes and harmful social norms.,Being a girl, I can testify that these gender stereotypes are real and have affected me in one way or another. An example of a victim of gender stereotyping is a girl growing up with her self-esteem, ambition and expectations already curved to fit the society in which she is raised.,Her choices for her own sexual and reproductive health are based upon norms that regulate women’s freedom, particularly in regard to their sexual identity and life, resulting in restrictions on her sexual and reproductive rights. Her choice to reject bride price, for instance, should be respected and valued.,Another example of gender stereotype is an empowered woman who chooses to go to school, get her degrees, build her own house, but is questioned by society about whether she will ever find a man who will marry her.,Due to the perception that her achievements intimidate men and will put her at risk of not finding a man, they question whether she will end up alone for the rest of her life. However, if these successes were logged by her male counterpart, this man would be labelled as a strong and successful person.,He will still be praised by society even if he chooses not to marry and no one will be bothered if he ends up alone and dies without marrying.,Violence against women and girls is also rooted in the patriarchal power imbalance between men and women, and in the dominant belief that men protect, provide for and have authority over their family and that good women prioritize their family’s health and wellbeing. After marriage, women’s most important role is to serve their husbands and raise their children.,According to the United Nations, “a gender stereotype is a generalised view or preconception about attributes, or characteristics that are or ought to be possessed by women and men or the roles that are or should be performed by men and women. Gender stereotypes can be both positive and negative for example, ‘women are nurturing’ or ‘women are weak’”. Gender stereotyping is the act of placing these attributes on to a woman or man solely because of their membership in the social group of women or men.,The strongest forces behind gender gaps are harmful social norms and stereotypes which limit the expectations of what women and men can or should do. These barriers discriminate against women. They are deeply ingrained and all around us.,Confronting and changing stereotypes is therefore vital to evolving how both women and men are able to operate in a society. This responsibility touches each and every facet of people’s lives, from what they see and experience at home, to what they learn at school, and how they are treated at work or on the streets.,When challenging these stereotypes and biases, we should be confident and firm, because women’s rights are human rights. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but speaking up will bring about transformation.,If we all choose to speak up, and challenge harmful social norms and stereotypes, we may inspire people to find the courage to speak up for themselves, and slowly bring the change we want to see.,It is everyone’s obligation to reshape these stereotypes; this shared goal’s success will have an impact on us all. Gender transformative approaches should include people of all ages, all genders, professionals in all services, and leaders in all structures if our central goal is to bring about gender equality, non-violence and power sharing.,T"

","If there were any doubts about the necessity of digital transformation to business sustainability, the Covid-19 pandemic has silenced them.,Organisers of Miss Rwanda beauty pageant announced that this year’s contest will be streamed on YouTube, with viewers paying 3 USD (Rwf 3,000) to watch the finale, scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 20, 2021.,When it was revealed that this year’s context will have a digital component to it, the reactions were mixed, with many asking why not postpone the context until people are allowed to gather again.  The organisers disagreed and went ahead with their digital plans focusing on the positives and future.,By going digital, the contest will reach larger audiences, boost engagement, build community and grow their revenue and influence as well as exposure beyond Rwanda’s borders.,When the coronavirus spread across the globe, changes become instant. In Rwanda, shortly after the first case was reported, orders were issued to stay home, large gathering were banned, and in-person businesses were restricted.,One year down the road, some of the restrictions are still in place and so is the virus. As a result, schools, organisations and businesses figured out how to use technology to continue their operations, serve their customers and more importantly, remain in business.,Before the pandemic, talk of digitisation was rife among businesses and organisations. Some had already kicked-off implementation of their digital strategies and others had it within their priority plans. However, what covid-19 has done, is to expedite these plans. Companies have been forced to seek digital solutions and invest in digital to future-proof their businesses.,According to a survey conducted by McKinsey & Company, a New York-based management consulting firm, as of July 2020, globally about 55 percent of products and/or services are fully or partially digitized, compared to 35 percent in December 2019 and 28 percent in May 2018, both before the pandemic.  ,The survey titled “How Cocvid-19 Has Pushed Companies Over The Technology Tipping Point—And Transformed Business Forever.” was conducted on-line from July 7 to July 31, 2020.,Twilio, an American cloud communications platform also surveyed more than 2,500 company decision makers about digital transformation and the results indicated that digital transformation had been accelerated by up to six years within their organisations.,According to the study, 97% of executives said the pandemic sped up their digital transformation, 95% said they’re looking for new ways to engage customers and 79% said Covid-19 propelled them to increase budgets for digital transformation.,While many may have scoffed at the Miss Rwanda contest for going digital, many more will acknowledge that the adoption of digital strategies opens a new world of opportunities, irrespective of the field you operate in. And, the pandemic has only served to remind the laggards that, with very rare exception, operating digitally is the only way to stay competitive in this new business and economic environment."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/celebrating-revamped-kigali-car-free-zone-imbuga-city-walk,"Celebrating a revamped Kigali car free zone (Imbuga City Walk)
","This week, we woke up to big news that the long awaited ‘Imbuga City Walk’ project on Kigali’s car free zone, as we know it, has come to fruition. The street will be transformed into ‘a recreational and green space’, whose implementation is on the move and expected to be complete within three months.,The news further detailed the project components as: pedestrian and cycling friendly pavements; green corridor landscaping; kiosks for food court and other items; exhibition zone; and kids’ playground. Several support facilities will also be in place such as; street benches and free WiFi; city lounge and arcade; pedestrian-friendly street lamps and public toilets. What more can we ask?,On 15th September 2015, I started making opinion column contributions in this newspaper, having been inspired by the then active debate on the events and aspirations on the car free zone.,I recall celebrating the move the City of Kigali had made in setting precedent on the war against the ‘asphalt and concrete jungle’ that has been attacking cities from all ends in this era of rapid urbanization.,At the time, I was only beginning my doctoral studies, on the topic of public space, disturbed by the fact that many cities especially in the global south have shown only marginal expansions in their public open space, despite the overwhelming expansion of the built environment.,Kigali’s intention to host her first ever car free zone at that point in time was indeed a terrific inspiration, as it served as a living testimony that cities can, after all, pay attention to their quality of urban life in unique ways, opening up possibilities in which streets could become successful social spaces.,Many other streets in Kigali remain ubiquitous with car use and hence why the idea of a car free zone, with pedestrians deserving a higher priority that vehicles that have growingly dominated the space, becomes an exciting one.,Over the last five years, we have had several pieces written on the topic of Kigali’s car free zone, published in this paper or elsewhere, and most of them have been sharing the concern that the street remained dead over a longer period of time, than expected.,The opinions, based on the optimism of the zone, have been good and healthy, as they kept a constant reminder to the city urban planners to fast track the process but we may not be having a lot of pace now to complain and rant about the absence of life and vibrancy on the street. The city has finally moved forward to nail it and basically we have been given three months, while the city completes the project, to start planning our activities on the Imbuga City Walk, obviously in respect to existing health protocols.,Considering that for the last 12 months we have largely been spending time in our homes or neighbourhoods, with travel restrictions in place and calls for social distancing as a way to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus, this news is both timely and relevant to us all. ,But just what will make the Imbuga city walk work?,The first conversation is around the concern of empty street. To ensure that the street does not remain ‘dead’ as we have critiqued it to have been, it will need people and activities. You and I will need to make intentional decisions to show up and be present there.,Obviously before the new design that is being implemented now, it was still difficult for the street to attract people and activities. There was not so much to do there, the zone, although absent of vehicles, was still not comfortable as it was without basic support facilities and amenities.,Now that there is a purposeful design in place, that is aiming to transform the zone into recreational and green space, one would expect that the addition of support facilities, improved accessibility, better linkages, safety and comfort, would make it substantially attractive leading to a more active and vibrant public space.,The second is around the businesses along the street. There has been concerns shared on the survival of businesses along the street, whose presence is of paramount important to the survival of the Imbuga city walk, but whose survival ought to be also supported by the public space.,This dialectic relationship is important since the street business will be affected by the street design changes. Hopefully, the case of a participatory design process, in which the business owners were involved in the conversations during both the design and implementation of the car free zone is expected to introduce business-friendly design elements that support both the social life as well as the economic life of the street.,Obviously business serve customers on their feet, not in their cars and hence the project increment in users of the Imbuga City Walk may as well bring in more customers to the adjacent businesses. The business on this zone have also been offered working service lanes parallel to the KN4 street and if they have survived the last 5 years of an empty street, they can only expect to do much better now.,The third is around equitable access. It is expected that the city walk will attract many more people than it has been doing in the last five years. Visitors will be drawn from the different economic levels and so a consideration in ensuring efficient bus transit from the various neighbourhoods in Kigali and other bus terminus, with efficient bus stops on either sides of the zone, would be very useful to the many visitors, especially the low-income citizen who rely on buses.,Bicycle lanes are already incorporated in the zone and this is expected to boost the already arising trend in cycling in Kigali.,The newly designed public space will be a container of multiple human activities, making it better capable of catering for our functional, social, and recreational needs in a more successful manner. This way, the Imbuga City Walk is expected to increasingly and positively associate with economic growth, better physical health of people and a stronger sense of community."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/why-china-decided-improve-hong-kongs-electoral-system,"Why China decided to improve Hong Kong’s electoral system
","The 4th session of the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) of China held recently made a decision to improve Hong Kong’s electoral system, aiming at a new electoral system that suits Hong Kong’s realities.,This is an important move to uphold the “one country, two systems” policy, to implement the principle of “patriots governing Hong Kong”, and to maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Let me share with you the following views.,First, it is imperative that China improves Hong Kong’s electoral system. Since Hong Kong returned to China as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) in 1997, the Chinese Central Government has all along fully and faithfully implemented the policies of ""one country, two systems"", ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy.,We have run Hong Kong affairs in accordance with the law, upheld the constitutional order in Hong Kong as established by the Constitution of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, supported the development of democracy in Hong Kong, with achievements recognized by international communities.,However, in recent years, anti-China, destabilizing forces and radical localists in Hong Kong have openly clamoured for ""Hong Kong independence"". Taking advantage of loopholes in current electoral system, they entered various government and legislative institutions via election, blatantly carried out activities to paralyze the functioning of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and obstruct the law-based governance of the SAR Government.,Some even tried to challenge the authority of the Chinese Central Government and seize jurisdiction over the SAR. The rioting and turbulence occurred in the Hong Kong society reveals that the existing electoral system in Hong Kong has clear loopholes and deficiencies. We feel obliged to take measures to improve the system and remove the risks.,Second, it is legitimate that China improves Hong Kong’s electoral system. Hong Kong is one of China’s local administrative regions, Hong Kong’s electoral system is in nature part of China’s local electoral system. How to develop and improve Hong Kong’s electoral system is purely China's internal affair, which foreign countries have no right to interfere in. Just as laws and rules concerning local elections in Rwanda need to be decided by the Parliament, China’s top legislature, the NPC has the right to decide on Hong Kong’s electoral system. This decision fully accords with China’s constitution, the Basic Law of Hong Kong, as well as worldwide common practices, and holds indisputable legitimacy.,Some western countries try to find fault with the “patriots governing Hong Kong” principle, but neglect their own requirements that their citizens or people in public office need to pledge loyalty to their country. It is more than reasonable that Hong Kong, as a Chinese SAR, shall be governed by people who love their country.,Third, it is favourable to Hong Kong itself if its electoral system gets improved. Democracy had been almost absent from Hong Kong’s 150-plus years of colonial rule, and has only been established and promoted since its return to China. China will not simply copy other country’s electoral system when improving Hong Kong’s, will instead proceed based on Hong Kong’s realities. The new system will reflect the interests of society, ensure extensive and balanced political participation, so as to promote social cohesion in Hong Kong. All in all, to improve the electoral system is to ensure a healthier and better development of Hong Kong’s democracy under the “one country, two systems” policy.,China and Rwanda share the same notion that the development path of a country shall only be chosen by itself and its people. We both adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect the sovereignty of states, and non-intervention in the internal affairs of any state.,Rwanda always expresses its support for China in implementing the ""one country, two systems"" policy, its opposition against foreign interference in China’s political and socio-economic issues, and its belief in China’s ability to manage its internal affairs.,This fully highlights the deep friendship between the two countries, and we applaud and appreciate Rwanda’s solidarity with us. China will remain committed to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. Hong Kong’s future will be brighter!,."

","Last week was somewhat fair to Rwanda, in comparison to previous ones. The countrywide vaccination process kicked off with the Ministry of Health reporting that over 250,000 people have so far received their first shots and many more looking forward to their date with the jab.,Rwanda stood out in the process as citizens and residents of all walks of life and social classes across the country included in the process.,This is indicative of the readiness of the country to resume ‘normalcy’ after weeks of preparation by the various authorities. The daily updates of the Health Ministry also point to dropping infection rates and rising recoveries.,The country was also found ready to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting scheduled for the 21st of June this year. The readiness is despite all the social economic problems the country and the world has had to deal with over the past year. The Commonwealth secretary general, on her three day visit in the country, said that the readiness was not only evident in the sites ready but also in the nation’s eagerness to receive guests without jeopardizing safety of both citizens and visitors.,This week, the eagerly awaited cabinet decisions brought a sigh of relief to many, as Covid-19 restrictions were eased further, including longer working hours and easier countrywide movement, breathing the much-needed oxygen into the national economy. ,The developments can be termed as a positive tide to make the most of.  A positive tide in that it’s an opportunity for the country to complete preparations ahead of the oncoming summit with less than 100 days to go as well as further allow resumption of economic activity to ensure previous years’ progress is not undone in the process.,The progress is not without its set of challenges which include ensuring that the country does not fall back in aspects such as letting our guard down with regard to the pandemic that is within our midst.,Even with the continued vaccination process, preventive measures still stand. Wearing masks well, sanitizing and ensuring social distancing is not yet behind us, at least for now."

","Somalia remains on course to join the East African Community, hopefully in the not too distant future. The Summit of EAC Heads of State , to follow up on the verification process for the country’s admission speaks as much.,Somalia’s application to join the Community has remained pending since 2012. A likely hitch explaining the delay is the country’s persistent. Its admission might however even take longer if it continues to be mired in election wrangles, which threaten , that bedevils the country.,There is little doubt the issues surrounding the missed deadline to hold the presidential elections last month can be overcome. But the collapse of talks yet again early this month to end the impasse show how fraught the situation is.,Among conditions a prospective state must meet to join the Community include adherence to good governance and democracy, and wherewithal to strengthen integration.,These conditions presuppose political stability, which in turn engenders consensus in decision-making in ensuring a country’s social and economic development.,A potential EAC member has to have these to integrate and effectively participate in the bloc.,This means Somalia has to urgently put its house in order. One of the contentious issues in the current wrangles is whether or not the constitution mandates that President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed (Farmajo) should have stepped down after his term expired on 8 February.,He believes the law allows him to stay in office until a new vote is held. The opposition is adamant he should not be in office after his term’s expiration. They accuse him of attempting to monopolise power and manipulating the electoral process to favour him.,However, the major areas of dispute that have stymied implementation of the September 2020 electoral agreement include the composition of federal and state-level electoral bodies that will oversee the polls.,Parties can also not agree over who should manage the vote for delegates originally from the self-declared republic of Somaliland. They are also at odds over how to conduct the election in Gedo, where the federal government and Jubaland administration have been locked in a year-long standoff.,At its core, the longstanding discord relates to unresolved questions overpower and resource sharing between the Federal government and the member states.,Political wrangles have also hurt cooperation on issues that require the central and regional governments to work together, such as security arrangements and completion of a provisional constitution.,The , suggests that, given the degree of distrust among Somalia’s elites, third-party mediation is urgently needed.,The UN and African Union (AU), backed by other international actors with influence in Somalia, such as the US, the European Union, the UK, Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, should step in now to broker a deal over how to manage the election and break a stalemate that could well push Somalia back into clan-based violence if it persists.,Reconciliation, particularly between the federal government and member states, should be a priority. Quick progress on all fronts is important, as by 2023 a new cycle of state elections will kick off carrying on toward the next federal election in 2024.,Given the difficult issues, it’s not simplistic to say there’s no reason the protagonists shouldn’t appreciate why Somalia is bigger than any one faction or member of the elite.,Reconciliation should be possible. Then holding the delayed elections will live up to the billing that they will be a ,.,While Al Shabaab extremists remain a problem, Somalia’s admission into the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa in 2018 shows how it might fit within the EAC, some of whose member states are part of the supraregional bloc that brings together 21 countries.,Membership in IGAD, despite ,, can also only help in integrating the country.,And, with the prospect of the Democratic Republic of Congo joining the East African Community with the promise to vastly enlarge the market it is another good reason to welcome Somalia to the party."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/value-added-tax-implications-intra-group-services-rwanda,"Value Added Tax implications on intra-group services in Rwanda
","For many groups of companies or multinationals, intra-group services, which are services provided by one or more entities within a group to other companies in the group, or for the benefit of the group as a whole, can be the kind of thing that cannot be just avoided.,Like attending the wedding celebrations of a cousin whom you hardly ever see and don’t actually like very much, it is your duty as a good family member to make that effort.,Some intra-group services such as management services, central purchasing, human resource and finance services can be directly provided by the parent company or one of the group company to other group companies (for want of a better term, I shall refer to these services as direct services) whereas other services like legal, tax, IT and marketing can be contracted-out or bought-in by one group company to the benefit of other group entities with the costs for such services being reallocated and recharged to other group companies using sensible allocation keys such as headcount and turnover. Sometimes a mark-up is added on the costs recharged.,Income tax (or at least transfer pricing) implications of intra-group services have attracted much attention, but VAT implications of such services can be sometime overlooked, hence the consideration of such subject by this article.,Consideration of VAT implications of intra-group services in Rwanda requires a look at the relevant provisions of law n° 37/2012 of 09/11/2012 establishing the value added tax (the “VAT Law”). In terms of article 3 of the VAT Law, value added tax is charged on taxable goods and services; and taxable imported goods and services.,Taxable goods and services are under article 2 of the same law defined as taxable goods or service supplied to a person, and this suggests that VAT must be charged, applying the relevant rate, on each supply of goods or services unless such goods or services are VAT exempt.,These provisions of the VAT Law can work easily with direct services, and unless such services are VAT exempt, VAT must be charged at the relevant rate whenever the supply of such services is made.,In case such intra-group services are supplied to the Rwandan group company by a foreign group company (imported services), VAT will be declared and paid by the Rwandan group company recipient of such services using the VAT reverse charge mechanism in accordance with article 12 of the VAT Law, and if such or similar services could be obtained on the Rwandan market, the VAT paid will not be allowed as deductible or refundable input VAT.,Conversely, the application of the above provisions to the contracted-out or bought-in services especially when the costs for these services are recharged to the group companies recipient thereof without a mark-up being added by the group entity that procured such services may not be an easy task.,This is largely owing to the fact apart from being procured by and invoiced to the relevant group entity, these services (e.g. training and employee development; and developing and monitoring of staff health procedures) are in some instances directly provided to the group entities recipient of the services by a third party original supplier.,That then gives rise to the question as to whether there is a supply of service by the relevant group company for the purpose of VAT, which this article answers in the affirmative in that the costs recharged by the relevant group entity at least cover the cost to such group entity of making the services available to other group entities recipient of the services, with all the value added tax implications alluded to in relation to direct services coming into play.,In any case, no VAT would apply if the cost recharged by the group entity is a disbursement in the sense that the relevant group entity had paid an invoice issued by a third party to one of the group companies and was recouping the cost from such group company. ,The above indicates that the issue of application of VAT on intra-group services is rarely that simple, and Rwandan companies supplying and/or making payment for intra-group services (as the case may be) should seek tax advice to ascertain whether or not service charges or recharges they receive from and/or pay to their parent companies or other group entities represent consideration for vatable supplies."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/editorial-inclusivity-key-all-public-buildings,"EDITORIAL: Inclusivity  is key in all  public buildings
","A renewed call is being made for owners of multi-storied buildings, especially apartments that have three floors and above to fit them with elevators so that they can be easily accessed by different users.,At the moment, many of these apartments do not have such amenities, which make the premises inaccessible by different people with special needs like people with disabilities, pregnant women and those of advanced age among others.,According to article 28 of the law governing urban planning and buildings in Rwanda, buildings intended for public use shall be built in a manner that allows access and use by persons with disabilities.,As such, on top of having ramps for use by people with disabilities, all buildings under the category G+3 and above (meaning that with a ground floor and at least three stories and above) must be fitted with elevators.,However, much as this regulation has relatively been respected in other commercial complexes, compliance has been lukewarm in buildings dedicated for residential use – or apartments – both within Kigali and the country at large.,Over the years, there has been a lot of effort put in enforcing different measures to ensure we have planned settlement in the country if you look at the different amenities that public buildings that are coming up must have, when you compare to the situation just a few years ago.,However, it is clear that authorities have not made priority the inclusivity and accessibility of these buildings.,The owners must not just ensure the elevators are fitted in their buildings, they should as well be fully functional at all times.,Some of the building owners are now making an excuse that their buildings were built before the law was passed and hence cannot be bound by it. This should not be acceptable, as long as these buildings are still in service.,The authorities should give such buildings a grace period to install these important amenities and failure to comply, the owners be held accountable.,Technology has greatly evolved in that installing elevators is no long the cumbersome and costly endeavor that it was a few decades back.,Besides, developers should look at this as an investment that they can pass onto the tenants because that facility is value added to the property."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/foreign-support-rwandas-criminals-turned-politicians-needs-be-called-out,"Foreign support for Rwanda’s criminals-turned politicians needs to be 
called out
","Observers of Rwanda’s politics are noticing dangerous patterns where an individual engages in criminality, claims political persecution, and then joins or forms a political organisation “to challenge” the government.,The problem with this path is that the moment politics becomes the arena for criminals, those who have genuine political ambitions to contribute to the society will shun politics.,In most societies, the best among them aspire for political leadership and are encouraged to do so because they can bring positive change. However, some foreigners want a different arrangement for Rwanda: they want to propagate the worst amongst us, convicted criminals and fugitives, to be the ones offering themselves to reconcile or to lead Rwandans even when the law is clear that a convicted felon cannot serve at any level of leadership.,Criminal charges or a conviction - and the notoriety that comes with it, seem to have become the surest way for one to either join a political party or to form one. However, because criminals don’t trust each other, they are more likely to form a new party than join an existing one.,This is the first sign that they don’t join politics for the right reasons: which would have been to serve the people. Obviously, no criminal - self-centred by definition - sees service to others as an important aspiration for their lives. It is their anti-social behaviors such as greed that drive them into criminality in the first place.,The political fugitives of the RNC are a case in point. Rusesabagina has equally been on the run until the law caught up to him. Ingabire Victoire sought to conceal her criminality behind politics. Many more are likely to surface because they enjoy the context of foreign interference that encourages and supports their criminal behavior in the name of politics.,Consequently, they join politics because they have an axe to grind, or see it as an easy pathway to self-aggrandizement. For one thing, like almost all criminals, they don’t accept that they did anything wrong – even when a mountain of evidence is looking them in the eye. The common joke here in town is that all criminals at the former 1930 Prison always said that they were innocent, even genocide perpetrators who every member of their community saw killing people in 1994. They say everyone is lying; they are innocent. They, too, have an axe to grind.,Most criminals choose to join politics because they failed to challenge the evidence that was used to convict them. Having been exposed by the justice system, they look to “challenge” the political system that didn’t interfere to stop the judges from sentencing them.,In the quest for this vengeance, they dedicate the rest of their lives to political manipulation and self-mythologization because they don’t think they will be able to stay away from criminality. Politics and unquestioning support from foreigners becomes a way of shielding themselves from the consequences of their certain recidivism.,Moreover, having destroyed their own reputations through their criminal behaviour, they try to manipulate others into helping them dilute and eliminate responsibility. The same way the leaders of the Genocide in 1994 told people that “if we all kill they won’t hold anyone accountable.”,It’s a cunning way to avoid the long arm of the law. If recidivism kicks in and they are held accountable for their felonies, they claim it is political persecution; it is the system being intolerant of dissent.,Like a mafia organization that uses a night club or a casino as a front for laundering illicit funds, criminals-cum-politicians create political parties to try to cover up their criminal reputations and reinvent themselves.,It is a diversion. A tool they use to fool people into joining them under the false belief that they have an agenda beyond petty vengeance and shielding themselves from the consequences of guaranteed future criminality.,It is short-sighted, however. Rwanda is a country of laws. Even though some continue to push the line and to regularly flirt with criminality, they know the red line beyond which they are guaranteed to fall foul of the law.,Finally, it is bizarre how these convicted criminals attract foreign support and sympathy in what has become a bizarre political charade. Often, it is the foreign elements that attract them with promises of funding and legitimacy to “challenge” the current government. If these busybodies were genuine in wanting to support politicians who would “challenge” the government in order to promote “competitive” politics, they would have plenty of law-abiding Rwandans to choose from.,There are limits to the cover pseudo politics offers from criminal liability. The kind of “democracy” they want for Rwanda with criminals as political leaders is dangerous for any country and for Rwanda in particular. It will never be tolerated when it undermines efforts to build a society that runs on the rule of law."

","It has been 14 years since the Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit (GFTU) was created as a unit in the National Public Prosecution Authority. Its mandate was to track people responsible for the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, so they can face justice.,The initial act by the unit was to work the sources and come up with indictments of all the fugitives and where they were. The list, which was progressively improved and it ended up with 1,146 fugitives scattered in at least 33 countries on different continents.,The team contacted all the host countries and handed them the indictments with an option of arresting these mass murders and either extradite them to Rwanda for trial or domestically try them.,Fast-forward to 2021, only 46 of these fugitives have been arrested and processed through courts, as announced last week by the head GFTU during a training of parliamentarians on the convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.,This means that 1,100 indicted fugitives are still at large. Besides these, there are others who were tried and convicted in absentia by Rwandan courts, especially the semi-traditional courts, Gacaca, who have never been found to serve their sentences.,Among the reasons why the small number of arrests as stated by prosecutors is the use of political cover by these fugitives to continue evading justice. They claim to be in opposition politics and therefore an attempt to bring them to book is seen as an attack on political opponents.,Some of those countries are in cahoots with the fugitives for different reasons and are covering for them to ensure they remain out of reach of the long arm of justice.,It is a travesty of justice that countries allow these mass murders to use politics to evade accountability for the crimes they committed in Rwanda. It is even more disturbing that majority of these fugitives are in Africa, more so within the Great Lakes Region.,It is imperative that these countries play their role as prescribed under the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to bring the fugitives to book.,Much as the crime of Genocide is imprescriptible in nature and therefore not bound by the statute of limitation, the time is running out and therefore they are growing old and may therefore not live long enough to have their day in court."

Rwanda-Arsenal deal?
","Last week Barney Ronay published an article in The Guardian UK with the title “, He was referring to Rwanda’s sponsorship deal with Arsenal Football Club where the latter promotes the “Visit Rwanda” brand. This is indeed a worthy question for debate. Unfortunately, Mr. Ronay does not address it with reason. As a result, he allows hostility towards the Rwandan government to lead the way in his framing of the debate and ends up misleading.,He gets out of the gates with a bizarre formulation that “the situation there [in Rwanda]” is of “international concern”. By this, he refers to unsubstantiated allegations of “deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture raised by the UK government that, in his view, should compel Arsenal to rescind this mutually beneficial partnership with Rwanda.,These allegations were dead on arrival when their main source that the UK government relied on was Human Rights Watch (HRW). Rwanda has been the cemetery of HRW’s reputation through a series of blunders that were documented by former U.S. official, Richard Johnson, who demonstrated that HRW has an axe to grind against the Rwandan government and that its advocacy on Rwanda is “,”.  ,Scholars like Phil Clark have questioned the organisation for its , that has persistently opposed the transfers and extraditions of genocide suspects to face justice in Rwanda, to say the least about dubious reports where ,. But it’s not just Rwanda that has buried the phony organisation whose reputation has sunken after a series of blunders, including ,.,In other words, this is not an organisation whose work any serious entity would reference as a basis for taking decisions that affect mutually beneficial relations. On the contrary, it warrants a decision on the part of Arsenal FC to reinforce its partnership with Rwanda by not only committing to “raising awareness of the country as a luxury holiday destination” but, more importantly, to actively challenge those, like Ronay, that wish to sabotage Rwanda’s incredible story of “culture, heritage and transition.” This would demonstrate the kind of moral clarity that eludes Ronay and Human Rights Watch.,Maybe with time Arsenal would bring some clarity to Ronay. First, no reasonable person still believes, for instance, that Paul Rusesabagina was “bundled on to a plane in Dubai to face what his family has called a sham trial on terrorism charges” as Ronay continues to insist despite evidence that includes , that even Rusesabagina could not challenge when given the opportunity to do so during his court hearing last week proving that the terror suspect found himself in Rwanda on his own volition without any iota of coercion.,As a result of these proceedings, no reasonable person still believes that Rwanda had no legitimate grounds to bring the terror suspect before the courts despite what until that time were distractions pushed by the mainstream media that attempted to render insignificant ,. Ronay suggests that by partnering with Rwanda Arsenal risks damaging its reputation when in fact it is The Guardian whose standing as a credible newspaper is damaged by rehashing his discredited views. This is despite , whose well-intentioned commentary is a cautionary tale for The Guardian in its quest to preserve its reputation.,On its part, The New York Times has salvaged its reputation with the publication of , on the Hollywood “hero” turned terrorist leader. In light of the evidence against Rusesabagina, the focus should shift to transnational terrorism and how to enhance cooperation to fight it. Freedom House’s distorted advocacy, which Ronay regurgitates uncritically, attempts to frame the fight against terrorism as “transnational repression.” Rather than advocate for the apprehension of terrorists wherever they may be, this thinking is a shot in the arm of terror groups; it blurs the line between legitimate and legal actions by the Rwanda government and dubious allegations of human rights violations. The war global war on terror, if it really also includes the protection of African lives, could use more clarity and less confusion.,The sooner the better for this kind of clarity for everyone involved. That’s because as more evidence is uncovered in Rusesabagina’s case, questions will arise as to why this man was not arrested sooner, in Europe or America, despite an international arrest warrant issued by Rwanda.,This indifference will shed further light on the question of why other terrorist groups that are hell-bent on overthrowing the government of Rwanda through violent armed struggle, including remnants of genocidal forces, continue to find safe haven mainly in Europe, as Honourable Andrew Mitchell has underscored regarding the obligation of the United Kingdom, for example. If everyone took their responsibility seriously, it would bring an end to the status quo of indifference to criminality, by those who purport to believe in the rule of law, and ensure that these criminal groups that have evaded accountability since are brought to book. After all, these are what the commonwealth values are about: to bring suspects to court, any court, even when others summarily execute them.,As a member of the commonwealth, it’s important that Rwanda’s culture and heritage constitute these shared values. In this regard, Arsenal is a pioneer in bringing Rwanda to the British people and helping to indirectly challenge negative perceptions about the Rwandan people. Three years after the deal, contemptuous arguments that question Rwanda’s investment on grounds of its low-income and aid recipient status have lost track and Ronay should know this much since he recognizes “that the campaign has been a success, lifting overall tourism numbers by 8%” and that “Rwanda has a functioning tourist industry”. The debate should now shift to how to continue this partnership in the midst of a pandemic that has affected the tourism industry worldwide and in terms beneficial to both partners. But such debate cannot take place in the toxic environment created by the likes of Ronay and facilitated by The Guardian."

","Today, as the world struggles to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the integrity of information and public messaging can be a case of life or death. Yet, we see on a daily basis content that questions vaccines or the reality of the corona virus itself.,Ultimately, this creates doubt and undermines efforts to deal with what is a global crisis. Many of us will have experienced misinformation leaking into our networks through family or friends, intending to create enough doubt and confusion to pull people from the trust they had in their institutions.,Misinformation is false information intended for unsuspecting or unsophisticated recipients. In some cases, the motive behind misinformation lies in advertising revenue, but worryingly, in the majority of others, the motivation is ideological, destructive and shrouded in elaborate conspiracy theories. Many people contribute to the spread of this misinformation unaware that it is a tool used to create disruptive noise that destroys objective truth.,A 2018 study by three scholars at MIT found that ,. In political discourse, the occurrence of misinformation, which was once seen as a political anomaly in the West, has now become a regular occurrence for many of us online.,The growth of our social media platforms has hugely contributed to the spread of online misinformation. Our platforms have provided a supportive environment for manipulators to share fake news and false information while reaping the benefits under the deep cover of the internet. Social media is its vehicle, as many of us look to our platforms to present us with news stories from an array of sources.,Admittedly, being able to receive instant information directly from ,, ,, or , is appealing for those who wish to stay informed, but these platforms have been rightfully criticized for enabling the spread of misinformation with little in the form of checks and balances.,Traditionally, print media cultivated a reputation with their readers, which relied on fact checking information before it was published. Today, our social media news is presented to us regardless of quality and reliability; there is no filtering system, neither are there editors acting as gatekeepers to ascertain the validity of information.,Clearly, the social media machine was never built to reliably inform its audiences but to keep the user engaged through an endless supply of content. In fact, information overload has brought us to a point where misinformation seeps into our knowledge sharing and becomes difficult for many to differentiate between the truth and outright deliberate manipulation.,Fake news that we hear so often these days has become more than shock headlines that simply bring in clicks and advertising revenue; it has become politically driven to influence self-detrimental behaviour.,The 2016 US election was a catalyst for the exponential growth of modern misinformation campaigns. A , found that fake news played a significant role in depressing Hillary Clinton’s support, which led to Donald Trump’s victory, notwithstanding the result of the popular vote. The attack was attributed to enemies of the state, as experts in producing fake content and foreign agents combined to target the most vulnerable groups with false information. Social media users over the age of 65 proved to be particularly susceptible to misinformation, , as the younger age groups. It proved to be a lesson in how powerful political misinformation can be, and subsequently the New York Times reports that at least ,.,Covid-19 will not be overcome without the investment of every citizen, and that is what makes the existence of misinformation against the pandemic even more dangerous. When we engage content that questions vaccines or the pandemic, these are directed efforts to create doubt against what should be an objective global health crisis. Our cyber security services need to figure out the origins of the misinformation we encounter and deal with it, but there is plenty we can do at an individual level to ensure we do not spread misinformation any further. In my view, three things need to be done.,First, we need to be clear that we understand how misinformation works. Just as vaccines introduce small doses of a harmful substance to learn how to defend it, it is beneficial to identify what misinformation and fake news look like so that they can be avoided.,Misinformation tends to come from unclear sources both in authors and references, so it is best to be extremely critical over dubious authors and other origins of information.,Before sharing the content compare it with previous examples of misinformation and employ critical thinking to study its validity.  ,Second, it is essential that we confront misinformation firmly within our social media groups.,With the vast amount of content we share daily, there is plenty of misinformation present from some of our family and friends who are unaware of its dangers.  It is imperative to hastily denounce it and to educate those who share misinformation unknowingly on the detrimental effect it can have.,Finally, we all need to think twice before sharing anything and examine the knock-on effect of what sharing one piece of information can have on the mindset of another person. ,Even the smallest pieces of information can have a huge influence on behaviour, especially as the spread of misinformation relies on the closeness of networks to add extra validation towards false information. ,It is also useful to ask yourself whether you know enough about a subject to endorse its worth before a share or a retweet. ,As we aim to continue preserving our development, it is imperative that we provide real value to our information. Defeating the pandemic is reliant on defeating the info-demic, and there is much we can do to stop its spread before things get out of control. Protecting the integrity of our information is a critical investment in securing our development as a knowledge-led society."

","Me, I’ve had it up to here! Everywhere I look or only point my head, this name assaults my feelings of decency and joie de vivre. The name Rusesabagina seems to be all over; on air, on screen, on paper, online, on-everything.,The energy expended on this man – expect my mouth never to utter this name again! – by all these good people and the not-so-good is more than he has used all his cooking life.,And his cooking life has been looong. Cooking all the way from the kitchens of Rwanda through to the kitchen of the then-prestigious Kenya Utalii College, from where he came as a chef.,After that, now he started the figurative cooking that saw him become manager of Hôtel Diplomate and, much later, nurse feelings of transforming into president of this country.,Roller-coasting to the top of this land, my foot!,But first things first. In 1994 as the then-government was fleeing, sowing death in its flight and leaving a trail of blood in its wake, he was going to wade through that blood to Gitarama, too, when the cooking bug tickled him. He went to Hôtel des Mille Collines for some looted fuel.,On finding the hotel abandoned by its owners, he saw the chance of a true cooking bonanza.,What’s out there is that he amassed bags of banknotes and promissory notes from the miserable victims escaping from the Genocide against the Tutsi before admission into Hôtel des Mille Collines, except a few close family friends.,That he kept the only international fax line for his cooking designs, denying the victims opportunity for a vital SOS call. That he kept the extremist RTLM radio updated with all victims under his ill-intentioned watch. That he cut water to many who resorted to chlorinated swimming-pool water.,All these and more greed-fed and hate-filled betrayals of his compatriots are well recounted by Edouard Kayihura who was the ‘inmate’ of the hotel and dared take time to see what was going on in all parts of the hotel as well as its environs. They are also documented in detail by Alfred Ndahiro and Privat Rutazibwa, from their research.,We’ll not go into how, later again, having landed an invitation and a decoration at the White House via so-called heroism cooked in Hollywood, he’d had his ego blown-up to bursting. Hubris which filled his head with visions of himself with the power to lord it over us.,He had the dollar-loot from a cooked-up charity organisation and speaking engagements, so what couldn’t he do? He organised to clinch the seat at the helm the way he only knew how; through violence. But that’s sub judice; the alleged terror attacks are shut from our public mention.,Suffice it to say the word “alleged” alone drills a hole into every heart of an orphan, a widow, nay, of every peace-loving Rwandan.,That aside, because his detailed behaviour in the hotel is from Rwandans who were there or dug up the details, no Western self-appointed expert on Rwanda would wish to throw a glance at them. They do not reflect the alternative “reality” of their liking.,They’ll never consider this government’s will to overlook all the barbarities of the time in the spirit of building a united Rwanda, either.,Nor will they want to hear the details of a man from their land who sets out to be faithful to his subject. Theirs is to jump on the chance of glorifying “their hero”, as per Hollywood, and use him as a springboard to vilify the person of President Kagame for his independent character.,Mr. Joshua Hammer and others of his respectable kind who give a faithful portrayal of the Rwandan situation are anathema to them.,Hammer has written such captivatingly detailed analysis, as a man who has been on the scene a number of times, that the rest of the cacophonous crowd must be crying in shame – if shame can feel another shame!,Honest Hammer, please do not quote this lounge (group) of lizard scavengers in the name of objectivity or balance. Personally, mention of any of their names turns my guts.,Because quoting the true hero of Rwanda’s recovery and rise in the same breath as a man suspected of sponsoring terror and his retinue of insult-hurlers has an underlying sense of moral equivalence.,Yet the rap that these Snows, Wrongs, Kurts, Thomsons, Péans, Birrels, Ronnays, the whole murky catalogue, have been copying and pasting from one another since 1994 is the same.,“Disappearances”, “murder”, “mysterious deaths”, “tyranny”, “threats”, “intimidation”, “imprisonment”, on and on, all put at the doorstep of Kagame.,Tell me, if any semblance of truth were to be associated with 26 years of this ugliness, wouldn’t these 12 million souls happily breathing this Rwandan fresh air have met their maker long ago?,The terror-sponsor suspect of their adoration must be laughing at them in his heart, seeing how he was among the first to get the Covid-19 vaccine.,In Belgium or USA that he so craves, his name would be somewhere near the bottom of the line!"

","I cannot believe that a year has gone by and we are still in this pandemic. To be honest, when I heard about the SARS - COV2 for the first time early last year, I did not think that it would get this worse.,Maybe I was too optimistic or biased because I had learned about and watched a few respiratory epidemics unfold (the SARS, MERS and swine flu unfold in the years 2000s and 2010s). It felt or sounded like it was far away, on another continent for a second.,However, I immediately realized that it was not. Most of all, I did not want to panic. I wanted to be prepared instead.,The question became how I could prepare for the unknown. Then my emotion network processing was activated and it has been like that since then. If you are feeling like me, you are not alone.,This past year has been a roller-coaster of emotions and feelings. We have questioned most of the things we do and why we do them. We all by now know someone who suffered from Covid-19. We have lost a friend or a relative to this pandemic.,Every aspect of our lives has been impacted by this pandemic. To make it worse, we have become great consumers of too much information from trusted and untrusted sources. After a year in this dizzying pandemic, understandably our feelings are high. As much as I wish this pandemic could be over tomorrow, it is likely that we still have some time with this SARS-CoV2 virus.,Why do I think so? There is no cure yet. However, if we continue to wash our hands, refrain from touching our faces, wear masks properly covering both our mouths and noses (I still see some people wear their masks on their chins or mouths and not covering their noses), respect physical (not social) distancing, and get vaccinated we will keep the infection rate down.,I also know that by now, everyone has heard about the vaccines and we all hope that this is a major step towards the end of this pandemic. I also know that there is much being said out there about these new vaccines. This does not help if one wants to make their decision on whether to accept or decline to take these vaccines. Let us look at it from a scientific point of view backed with evidence.  ,There are several vaccines against Covid-19 at different stages of development currently. If you are wondering why that many vaccines? Many doses are needed to get as many people as possible vaccinated around the world.,So far, about 300 million people have been vaccinated. Many of them are in 10 countries. About seven vaccines have been approved for emergency use worldwide. Some of these vaccines such as Moderna, Pfizer, and CureVac vaccines are messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA), two shots in the muscle of the upper arm, 21 and 28 days apart respectively.,I have read some comments from people who are concerned by the fact that some of these vaccines are mRNA vaccines, thus, may be wondering if they should go ahead and take them or not. What does that really mean?,mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. I should mention that until last year, the way vaccines were made had not changed that much for more than two centuries.,Many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated virus or bacteria in our body to trigger an immune response. Not mRNA vaccines, thanks to the advancements in science and technology of the 21st century. mRNA vaccines, give instructions (it is a messenger) to our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response in our bodies.,Then, the immune system produces antibodies, and these antibodies protect us from getting severely sick when we get in contact with the virus.,I have also seen videos of people saying that they cannot take the vaccine because these vaccines were developed so fast, thus, they do not trust them. Again, thanks to the science behind mRNA vaccines and the dire situation this pandemic has placed the entire world in, the new vaccines were made fast.,For the first time in history, scientists considerably collaborated effectively and faster than ever before. Heads of governments were quick to respond and avail funds to support pharmaceutical companies to make these vaccines (which had been rarely done before) and the prior knowledge that vaccines work.,Smallpox and rinderpest (also known as cattle plague) diseases eradication and the decrease in under-five mortality thanks to the global coverage of vaccination against many infectious diseases of childhood with the expanded programme of immunization are the best examples. In other words, the collaboration, government support and the urgency of the situation justifies the fast processes.,Large clinical trials are still under way. Preliminary results from these trials helped establish the efficacy of the vaccines currently being used.,I have heard also people who say that they fear the unknown long-term side effects of the vaccine. It is true, no one knows yet. The same way we do not fully know the sequelea of COVID-19. Studies are underway, stay tuned.,All in all, I know that this a personal decision, however, I would like to encourage everyone to make a well-informed decision. If you are a healthcare provider, please take the vaccine. Remember you are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and we need you to take care of others.     ,."

Unfortunately, there is widespread of false and incorrect information disseminated on the matter by the Sudan. With the objective of setting the record straight and relaying accurate information, the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia in Rwanda presents this note.,The boundary of Ethiopia and Sudan was delimited by the 1902 Treaty signed between Emperor Menelik of Ethiopia and Great Britain, the colonial power of Sudan. Article 2 of the Treaty establishes a Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) to marking and delimiting the boundary on the ground.,However, in 1903 a British surveyor by the name of “Charles Gwynn” unilaterally demarcated the boundary disregarding the 1902 Treaty.  Ethiopia rejected it and communicated its position that the unilateral exercise by Great Britain is void.  ,In 1972, after a lengthy dialogue and negotiation, Ethiopia and Sudan adopted an Exchange of Notes that provides for the agreement of the two countries to re-demarcate the boundary. In the re-demarcation exercise, Ethiopia and Sudan agreed to use the “Gwynn Line” only as a basis and to make rectifications to it.,The 1972 Exchange of Notes is an outcome of compromise on the parts of both Ethiopia and Sudan. Ethiopia agreed to work on the re-demarcation, taking the “Gwynn Line” into consideration. Sudan agreed to drop its position that “Gwynn Line” is the final demarcation, and accepted the re-demarcation of the boundary based on mutually agreed rectifications. Hence, the 1972 Exchange of Notes makes it abundantly clear that Major Gwynn’s demarcation is not final and conclusive.,In line with the Exchange of Notes, Ethiopia and Sudan established joint mechanisms to deal with border re-demarcation. These include, the Joint Boundary Commission (JBC), the Joint Technical Boundary Committee (JTBC) established under the JBC, and the Joint Special Committee. The Special Committee also conducted important discussions. Nevertheless, all the committees have not yet completed their mandated tasks.,In carrying out the re-demarcation process, both countries will, among many other things, apply the 1972 Exchange of Notes, rules and standards for border demarcation, including settlement pattern, effective control and most importantly the durability of the boundary and border stability. In the meantime, Ethiopia and Sudan have an obligation to respect the status-quo.,Most recently, the Prime Ministers of Ethiopia and Sudan established a High Level Political Committee on Boundary Issues that was tasked to deliberate on reactivation of the boundary demarcation mechanisms.,In its meeting held in Addis Ababa on 16 – 17 May 2020, the High-Level Politic Committee reached an agreement to continue to work towards the resolution of the boundary issues within the existing frameworks and agreements as well to strengthen cooperation to combat illegal activities and reactivate people-to-people relations.,Sudan, in its recent act of invasion violated these solemn commitments. The acts of Sudan have entailed loss of mutual trust and spoiled the efforts made to create a stable and economically and socially vibrant border area.,The Sudanese National Army violated the basic principles of international law and peaceful settlement of disputes and invaded Ethiopia in early November 2020 while Ethiopian National Defense Force was engaged in the law enforcement measure in the Tigray Regional State.,The areas that the Sudan invaded are under the effective administration of Ethiopia before and since the signature of the 1902 Treaty, and most certainly since the conclusion of the 1972 Exchange of Notes.,In 2004/2005, the Joint Selected Working Group of Ethiopia and Sudan conducted aerial survey and registration of holdings. This undertaking established that, Ethiopians reside and conduct regular economic and social and political activities, west of the “Gwynn Line” governed by Ethiopian law and Ethiopian authorities.,Ethiopia’s resolve for peaceful settlement of the controversy was manifested even after Sudan invaded Ethiopia’s territory. The Sudanese side denied the invasion and declined the offer by Ethiopia to peacefully and diplomatically address the matter.,Ethiopia remains committed to finding lasting solution through negotiation and agreements in the framework of the existing normative and institutional mechanisms to re-demarcate the boundary and settle the controversy."

This implies that they will have been forced out of their bed as early as 5am or even before, depending on their proximity from the school.,This is a dangerous practices, as experts say that that the early morning sleep that children are deprived of is very important for their proper upbringing, while effects of such practice can have on them, including distaste for school.,According to science, the first three years of a child are the most important in their life where at least 80 per cent of the child’s brains grow within the first three years and this is greatly shaped by the environment in which they grow.,To address this issue, some of the measures fronted include coming up with a special time table for pre-school and nursery pupils such that they can start school much later than their siblings in upper classes.,However, it emerged that this would do little to fix the challenge for many, because the main issue, as it turned out, is logistical; where these children share buses with their older siblings, and separating their time of commute may be difficult or have much higher cost implications on both schools and parents.,A much-more feasible solution would be having nursery schools as close to home as possible to avoid long commute for the children.,This can be done in a multipronged fashion and requires both public and private investment.,On the public side, there is already work in progress where a policy in place for Early Childhood Development (ECD) has a target to have at least two model ECD centres in every cell of every sector in the country.,This drive can be supplemented by having incentives for private players to venture into this sector, to ensure parents get quality schools near them to cut down the commute.,This would however requires mindset change on the part of parents, to give a chance to these new facilities close to home instead of taking their children in far-flung schools."

This means doing research on the property to determine that everything is in good order. It is important to establish whether the property is the subject of a caveat, a mortgage or an ongoing dispute.,By simply dialing *651# on your phone and following the prompts, including providing the UPI number of the land where the house is located, you can establish whether there is a caveat or a mortgage over the property.,It is advisable to do an additional search by requesting the developer to write to the Registrar of Land Titles of the province where the land is situated and requesting for the same information. This request can only be made by the developer who is the owner of the land.,A caveat means that somebody who is not the current registered owner of the property has registered a claim with the Registrar of Land Titles over the same property. This claim prevents any transaction on the property from happening until the caveat has been lifted.,This normally arises when there is a dispute over the ownership of the land and then one or several of the parties to the dispute, request the Registrar of Titles or court to place a caveat on the land.,If there is a caveat on the property, this is a red flag and it is not advisable for you to continue with the purchase as you may get entangled in a long, messy and expensive dispute.,If you really must continue with the transaction, it is best to wait until the disputes over the property have been fully resolved and the rightful owner determined.,Even if there is no caveat, it is still prudent to find out the previous ownership of the house so as to reduce the risk of purchasing a property whose ownership is disputed or which has been acquired fraudulently. In Rwanda, fraud cases over property are relatively very low compared to other countries in the region, however, it is better to be safe than sorry.,If your search or the Developer reveals that there is a mortgage, it is an indication that the developer has a loan with a financial institution (normally a bank). This is not unusual as some developers rely on additional financing from banks to undertake their housing projects. A mortgage is a legal agreement which states that in case a borrower fails to pay a loan, the lender will have a right to sell the property which is the subject of the agreement and pay itself first from the proceeds of the sale and if there is any balance, it will give it to the borrower.,In law, a bank which has mortgage over the property has a much greater claim to the property than a buyer who has signed a house purchase contract and has paid the full purchase price for the house. Therefore, if the developer was to default on the loan to the bank, the bank would have a right to take over the property and sell it to someone else even if you, the buyer had already paid the developer the full purchase price.,If you establish that the property is under a mortgage, it is important to ask the developer to have the mortgage released by the bank before you can buy the property. Alternatively, you can enter into a direct contract with the developer’s Bank in which it commits to release the mortgage before or as soon you pay the purchase price.  ,Or, you can structure your payments to the developer in such a way that, you pay as little as possible upfront as a deposit and the remaining balance of the purchase price is paid after obtaining the title deed to the house with no mortgage.,That way you only stand to lose your small deposit in case the developer defaults on its loan and the developer’s bank takes over the property. However, the developer may not want to sign over the transfer of title to you before receiving the balance on the purchase price as the developer is not sure that you will pay it after you have received the title deed.,A possible solution is to pay the balance to a trusted third party like your bank, which will keep the balance on behalf of both you and the developer until the title has been transferred to you and then the third party will pay the balance to the developer. This concept is called an escrow. If you are borrowing money from your Bank to finance your purchase, this will provide further comfort to you as your bank will act as the trusted third party and will also facilitate the process of the developer’s bank releasing the mortgage on the title.,Lastly, it is important to critically review the house purchase contract. Many Buyers think that their contract is written in stone. They do not realize that the terms can be changed. Moreover, sometimes the developer pressures the buyer into signing the contract by claiming that the contract is standard and all other buyers have accepted to sign it without any modifications.,Even if this were true, simply because every other buyer has signed a contract without requesting any changes, does not mean you should too. It is advisable to have a lawyer look at the house purchase contract. ,Many buyers fear to hire the services of a lawyer because they believe lawyers are expensive. They are willing to risk making a mistake worth several million francs in order to save a few hundred thousand francs in lawyer fees which is simply not smart.,Owning a home is the dream for many of us. Taking a few simple precautions can prevent this dream from becoming your worst nightmare."

Day
","On Monday, 8th March, Rwandan corporations like the rest of the world put their best foot forward to mark International Women’s Day (IWD). Some posted endearing messages on social media and any available platforms while others handed roses and candy to their employees and clients.,In the process, speeches and posts were made about the women composition in their respective companies and boards as well as how much they are inspired by the women.,In the process, there were commitments made to increasingly ensure that their respective ecosystems are conducive for women.,In some instances, this is the only time in the year that women feature as a priority in the institutions.,However, as the roses wither and the speeches echo away, this would be a good time to commence the implementation and actualization of commitments made to challenge the status quo.,This would be a good time to commence looking inward at interventions that would address challenges that women working in their institutions work.,For instance, while maternity leave is no longer an issue in most organizations, more can be done to improve the work environments. For instance, with the exception of a few local private institutions, maternity leave does not exceed 3 months.,It is also not uncommon to come across instances whereby firms may be hesitant to hire women or promote them to certain positions for fear that they could be away during maternity leave.,It is also not uncommon to find instances of women held back from certain jobs, roles as they have previously not been found to be ‘female roles.’,While multiple studies have revealed that firms with higher levels of gender diversity, and policies and practices have increased creativity and innovation, only a few firms have moved in to improve their environment and workspaces for women.,As opposed to waiting for 2022 March to prioritize women, it is time to go beyond the speeches, social media posts and flowers to put their money where their words are."
https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/where-justice-and-architecture-meet,"Where justice and architecture meet
","Rwanda’s Supreme Court has moved to a new building in Kacyiru. It is a striking structure, all glass and stuff, not the sort usually associated with courts of law. The old building in Kimihurura wasn’t much different, just an unremarkable square structure with a part of it sticking up into the sky.,It is not usual for the Supreme Court in any country to move house. So when it does you take notice. There must be a good reason or some other significance.,The court building is normally one of those key landmarks in the capital that serve as reference points, recognisable for their permanence and unique architecture and function. You don’t have to be told whether a particular building is a courthouse, parliament or government office. They have features that identify them as such.,Neither the old building of the Supreme Court, nor the new one have any distinguishing features in the traditional sense that mark them as a temple of justice. That is perhaps why it is easy to move it without as much as a murmur in support or protest.,There is another sense in which you would be struck by the relocation and the new home of the Supreme Court if, like me, you spent a good part of your life in places where courts have a different architectural design.,In the old East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) court buildings were impregnable structures, fortresses really, ugly and forbidding, and apparently designed to intimidate, not to inspire confidence. And then there is archaic dress and language, and strange rituals to match, all intended to awe but also befuddle.,Not surprisingly, ordinary people approach them with trepidation, unsure whether they will get any justice at all. Some even fear they will be sent to jail even when they have not committed or been accused of any crime.,These architectural and even philosophical differences have roots in the history of the respective countries in the region. In traditional East Africa, courts were a British creation and were meant to serve imperial interests. For this they had to be housed in structures that were intimidating to natives. The British intended to stay for a long time and so created permanent structures and systems that resembled what they had at home and reflected their intentions in the colonies.,In Rwanda on the other hand, the Belgians did not build anything that suggested intentions of permanence and so did not put up any remarkable or lasting structures, especially architectural. Or perhaps they were disdainful of the natives to bother with any elaborate infrastructure.,In terms of justice, they administered a rough form of it and for this they did not need uniquely designed structures, except, of course, prisons.,This reluctance or inability was perhaps a reflection of a feeling of insecurity arising out of their own inadequacy as an imperial power. After all Rwanda had been dropped into their laps by circumstances of history. It was acquired as part of the spoils of war and punishment of Germany after World War I.,Rwanda was different in another sense. It had its own institutionalised national justice system, delivered in the open, accessible to all citizens and in which they all participated. More importantly, they believed in it.,Rwandans are good at litigation. They will go to court for the slightest suspicion of injustice. They were even more so in the past. Nearly everyone was an expert on court proceedings and could tell where court had been fair or biased and would be sure to remind the authorities of this whenever an opportunity arose.,Those things that Rwandans valued are indeed the principle that underpins justice even today: openness, fairness, equality before the law, both in reality and perception. It is also what every palace of justice should be: open and accessible, inspire trust and confidence, and not cause fear and apprehension.,It shouldn’t therefore come as a surprise that we are seeing evidence of it today in the ongoing case of Paul Rusesabagina and his FLN associates. It is part of the tradition, not something done to please some noisy outsiders.,The new home of the Supreme Court should be seen in this light of a tradition of openness (apart, of course, from the practical necessity of giving way to new developments). Openness and keeping with the times gives a sense of transparency and fairness, of the here and now and therefore more understanding and inclusion – a sort of people’s temple of justice.,The architecture must be part of it since it reflects the history, philosophy and values of a people. But that said, the Supreme Court needs a permanent home both as symbol and fact because that gives it a sense of solidity, endurance and reliability."

","Rwanda joined the rest of the world to celebrate International Women’s Day on Monday, March 8, 2021. Organisations, businesses, families, and society, in general, took time to celebrate how far we have come in achieving gender equality. ,However, Covid-19 has reminded us that we still have a long way to go to challenge biases. When Covid-19 hit and lockdowns were put in place to slow its spread, reports of women having to bear the brunt were rife.,Cases of domestic conflict increased and to make matters worse, leaving an abusive relationship during a lockdown was even more complicated for a society that frowns upon women leaving their marital homes. ,On the employment front, there were two main challenges; job loss is one of them. Experts argue that gender segregation in the labour market contributed to women finding employment in areas that were mostly affected by the pandemic.,These include cross-border trade and foodservice chain. The other is the work-from-home directive that most employers put in place to keep their staff safe. In addition to doing their official duties while at home, there were other responsibilities such as domestic chores and childcare/home-schooling as everyone had to stay home. ,As we celebrate the achievements of women, it is imperative that we build on the existing efforts and policies to ensure that women are protected from unforeseen situations including pandemics. ,Take for example the construction sector. It was one of the areas that have resumed work after lockdowns are partially lifted. If contractors pledge to ensure a substantial percentage of workers are women, the rewards would be far-reaching. ,And, as a society, we must have more conversations about changing the mindset that domestic chores and child-care are the responsibility of the women only.,If this was collectively perceived to be a shared responsibility, the work-from-home directives would not have placed extra responsibility on women. We must continually challenge such biases. "

","International Women’s Day is an opportunity to reflect on the progress our societies have made and to recommit to building a world where all young women have the chance to realise their full potential, regardless of their gender or background.,According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women and further exacerbated gender inequality. Women around the world are more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to the unbalanced burden of unpaid work such as childcare, household chores and caring for the elderly.,Indeed, many sectors hit hardest by the pandemic are gendered in nature - tourism and hospitality, health, as well as education are just a few examples. The informal sector - crippled by the pandemic - is majority female. Findings from the Labour Force Survey, indicate that in 2019, 91.2% women were informally employed.,By taking a gender lens to remove barriers to employment, , has learnt a number of lessons as we build African solutions to the global challenge of youth unemployment. We know that these barriers are higher for women than men. In the last three years of supporting young Rwandans to secure income-generating opportunities, we have identified four key lessons that we know can enable women to reach their full potential.,Ernestine Turabayo is a young mother living in Kigali who provides for her family alongside raising her child. Previously, she didn’t have the time or money to attend Harambee’s four-week in-person English Acceleration Programme. It was only after we began offering online training that she was able to participate.,Ernestine told us: ,Our fifth English Acceleration cohort saw a 10% increase in female completion - up to 53% from 43% for our previous four cohorts, which required in-person participation. By designing online and flexible programmes for women’s realities, which often include household and familial responsibilities, we have seen increased participation and completion of programmes that are now specifically designed to open more earning opportunities for them.,Since we began working in Rwanda, we have seen less participation from women in our programmes (41% on average). To address this, and draw on the early successes of women-focused sessions with partners like Fawe and Maranyundo Girls school, we introduced women-only online Work-Seeker Support (WSS) sessions. We quickly realised the enthusiasm among some women for this offering.,Divine, who attended one of the sessions, told us: ,By creating spaces for women to share their experiences in finding a job and building their networks, Harambee aims to empower and accelerate their pathways to learning and earning opportunities.,Joselyne Iradukunda was one of the first candidates Harambee pathwayed to an opportunity with one of our employer partners, Volkswagen Mobility Solutions. VW was looking to hire drivers and was equally committed to making the opportunity available to women - even though driving in Rwanda is often seen as a traditionally male role.,According to Joselyne, “,This outcome was made possible thanks to the shared commitment of Harambee and VW to make all opportunities open to women, and a commitment to supporting them in their employment journey.,Rwanda stands out for its commitment and achievements in elevating women to leadership positions. Female representation in Parliament stands at 61% and women’s representation in middle management in the private sector has increased by 27%, according to McKinsey.,We have learned that in addition to supporting young women, sharing success stories is a critical force multiplier. This inspires more young women to keep progressing in their employment journey. Sharing stories on radio, social media and in our programmes has allowed women to see the diverse career pathways other women have navigated, and therefore made subsequent paths much clearer.,Incorporating these lessons has enabled us to lower the barriers for women to both training and employment opportunities, but there is more work to be done to remove those barriers completely. On International Women’s Day, Harambee is committed to continuing to learn, iterate, and scale to achieve gender equity in earning opportunities for Rwanda’s young people."

But this year, set against the backdrop of heightened gender inequities, we should leverage it to collectively advocate for tangible, systematic changes for women, as a sustainable movement that transcends the confines of a single day.,This year’s IWD campaign theme ‘#ChooseToChallenge’ calls on individuals to advocate for gender equity in their respective communities. Yet institutions must also recognize, to promote equity and mainstream gender, both inwards - by taking a mirror to their own organizational structure - and outwards - by taking steps to initiate and contribute to, movements that promote women.,The University of Global Health Equity (,), a global health sciences university based in Rwanda, is one organization committed to taking explicit steps to create equity within its community and globally.,Equity in health starts with equity in education, a concept immediately visible in UGHE’s student recruitment structure where women comprise 70% of its medical cohort and 100% of students receive needs-based financial support to study. ,This deliberate structure goes beyond the traditional process of shortlisting and selecting candidates, and takes into account , - like domestic responsibilities, early marriage and pregnancy, and financial barriers - that limit high-school girls’ access to further education.,UGHE addresses this by visiting all-girls schools across the country, introducing students to female role-models from its student and alumni network, taking entry-exam sites to all provinces, and providing immersive science days on campus to subvert ingrained gender norms that discourage girls from studying STEM.,These gender norms contribute to why women hold ,, and make up less than 30% of the world's researchers. Role models have significant influencing power in addressing gaps in female scientists, researchers and global health leaders, and strong mentorship programs help institutionalize this by fostering transfer of knowledge across diverse disciplines to support young women navigate the often-labyrinthine path to leadership.,Comprising of 67% and 92.5% female mentees and mentors, respectively, UGHE’s Center for Gender Equity (CGE)’s pioneering Mentorship Program focuses on providing actionable frameworks for successful mentoring that serve both parties; with mentors benefitting as much from the process as mentees.,Similarly, the path to gender equity ought to focus on strategically planned, actionable goals. Organizations with a self-professed gender agenda must look at their own internal structures, assess the ingrained gender bias, identify gaps in supportive networks and resources for women, and analyze the culture that may adversely affect women ascending into leadership roles. ,The CGE, whose purpose is to , throughout UGHE, is taking action through a first-of-its-kind Gender and Diversity Inclusion audit, studying academic activities, student and community engagement and gender and diversity sensitivity in the organizational culture and practices.,The participatory audit mobilized a diverse task force and collected input from all genders and minority groups at every organizational level through Kinyarwanda and English self-assessment questionnaires, individual in-depth staff interviews and a quantitative review of institutional policies.,Today, there is simply no excuse not to make workplaces more inclusive to women. , and yet the majority of workspaces around the world are not adapted to support new mothers, or agile working to help women balance childcare responsibilities with those at work.,UGHE’s inclusion of a mother’s room in Kigali and on its Butaro Campus provides a private, hygienic space for lactating mothers to breastfeed or pump and store breast milk. , UGHE’s students who menstruate are provided with free sanitary pads.,Such explicit ‘gendered’ steps are necessary to overcome existing power dynamics and social norms that limit women’s participation. In Butaro, UGHE’s Department of Community Health & Social Medicine is creating formal frameworks to guarantee women’s voices are heard, and further ensures inclusion by providing oral and sign language translators during communal activities.,UGHE also mandates its contractors and service providers to have an 80% locally sourced, 50% female labor force. Upcoming initiatives such as carpentry programs and mobilizing funding to support small Butaro-based businesses affected by the pandemic, are all attached to quotas to guarantee female participation.,By taking deliberate, participatory steps to ensure a gender agenda in both internal operations and external activities, organizations can collectively shift the dial towards a more gender-equal world.

This year, it is being held against the backdrop of devastating health and economic crisis, resulting from the global Covid-19 pandemic that we mark the day.,And like many other issues, women have been affected the most. A 2020 UN Women report -,, estimates that “the pandemic will push an additional 96 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, 47 million of whom are women and girls”.,Despite the fact that they have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19, women have once again demonstrated their courage, strength and resilience in the pandemic preparedness and response, in Rwanda, in the UAE and all over the world from the top leadership down to the communities and families.,When I reflect on the role that women play from being pillars of family to nation and peacebuilding, the only question I ask myself is: “We have inherited a gender-imbalanced society but what are we doing to bridge the gap?”,The Covid-19 pandemic and its impact are a stark reminder of the urgency needed to step up action towards gender equality and women empowerment.,Tremendous effort and reforms have been deployed to change the status-quo inherited in the last two decades, including in Rwanda and the UAE and today we celebrate women in leadership positions across national, regional and global institutions.,In the most recent past, the world applauded the election of Nigerian Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, the election of Rwandan economist Dr Monique Nsanzabaganwa as the vice-chairperson of the African Union Commission, the election of Hon. Louise Mushikiwabo as the fourth and current Secretary-General of , and many more.,One can draw parallels with the equally laudable successful Hope Probe Mission to Mars, a vision of the UAE leadership come true and the magnificent groundbreaking World Expo2020 officially starting in October of 2021 in Dubai both historic in the sense of the word with women leaders at the helm.,These women trailblazers continue to be the shining light that young ladies follow and emulate along their path. Undoubtedly, women ascension to decision-making positions works to reaffirm their potentials, the world trust them and acts as a good opportunity to drive and support the gender equality agenda across nations.,Reflecting on the much-needed political will, Rwanda and the UAE share a common vision with regard to women empowerment. High levels of women participation in the UAE Cabinet, distribution of positions in government institutions by gender with women making up 66 per cent of the public sector workforce in UAE, as according to the UAE Gender Balance Council recent data, the country is arguably leading the region in gender parity.,After the devastating effects of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi which destroyed the socioeconomic fabric of Rwanda, the government placed gender equality and women empowerment at the forefront as full recovery could only be possible with women and men equally contributing to the country’s vision for development.,Rwandan women have taken advantage of these opportunities and made major strides in realizing their dreams while changing the world around them. Deliberate gender equality policies by Rwanda’s Government have paid off.,Rwanda is now a global leader in women participation in legislative decision-making positions with 61.3% female members of Parliament and also ranked 9th globally in closing gender gaps according to the Global Gender Gap Report, 2020. In addition, 52% of the Cabinet members are women, among the Judges and clerks, women stand at 49.7% while in the local government leadership, women occupy 45.2 % as Members of District Councils.,Given the country’s recent history, Rwanda understands best the cost of insecurity and the responsibility to protect. In the UN peacekeeping missions, Rwanda has the second-highest number of women peacekeepers who contribute to peace and relief around the world. Wars and disasters everywhere affect women and children disproportionately, it is always important to have a woman’s voice and helping hand next to a woman victim in time of need.,In the education sector, gender parity has been stable with girl’s enrollment standing at 49.5% against 50.5% of male at primary level while the enrolment of girls in secondary education increased to reach 53.3% against 46.7% of boys’ enrollment, according to 2019 Education Statistics of the Ministry of Education.,Economically women and girls have the same access rights to land ownership and inheritance as their brothers do in Rwanda. Suffice to say, Rwanda’s progress in women empowerment is a result of a solid foundation laid by the highest political will, deliberate legal and policy frameworks among other mechanisms.,As we mark the International Women’s Day of 2021, a lot remains to be done to achieve gender equality, let us all together strive for a world where equality and equity prevail., "
