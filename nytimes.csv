https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/infrastructure-crisis-united-states-projects.html,The Infrastructure Crisis That Biden Is Confronting,"Speaking outside Pittsburgh today, President Biden outlined a $2 trillion plan to invest in the country’s infrastructure, creating millions of jobs in the process.,“It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down,” he declared, calling the plan “a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago.”,Public investment in infrastructure, as a share of gross domestic product, has been , for the past half-century, and it has recently become a topic of growing concern across party lines. President Donald Trump proposed , in 2018, though it was not as far-reaching as Biden’s plan, and it never became law.,So how did we get to a place where major infrastructure improvements are so clearly necessary — and what are the biggest needs?,The American Society of Civil Engineers has been releasing an Infrastructure Report Card every four years for over two decades, and the evaluations have never been very positive.,This month , its latest ,, giving the United States’ infrastructure a C- over all. That’s a shabby grade, but it reflects a modest amount of recent improvement: It is the first time that the overall score has been higher than a D+.,“We’ve made a little bit of incremental progress,” Emily Feenstra, the engineering society’s managing director for government relations and infrastructure initiatives, said in an interview today, adding that these improvements had been made largely at the state and local levels.,“What you’ve seen is treading water, almost nibbling away at the margins, when it comes to our nation’s infrastructure,” Feenstra said. “Cities and states are doing what they can to invest, funding new technologies, but there hasn’t been that kind of transformational investment that would really give us the bump up to put us on good economic footing.”,The report card analyzes the nation’s infrastructure in 17 categories, including roads, schools, transit and drinking water. Bridges were the only category in which the grade had declined from four years ago, now sitting at a C. Eleven categories have a grade in the D range, reflecting the extent to which bridges and other transportation infrastructure , in recent decades.,The coronavirus pandemic has heightened the need for federal assistance in a number of ways, including on the transit front, as , has sent revenues plummeting — putting , on already hard-up transportation systems at both the local and national levels.,But most of the nation’s infrastructure needs are longstanding, and many have to do with climate change. Storm-water infrastructure, for instance, was the one new category on the report card this year.,The extreme weather that compromised the power grid in Texas last month , of the ways in which climate change can threaten systems that lacked strong public investment. And it highlighted the ways in which infrastructure systems are intertwined.,Biden’s infrastructure proposal defines its purpose broadly, something that has pleased analysts at the engineering society. “It’s nice to see the comprehensive approach,” Feenstra said. “Not just roads, bridges, transit — which are important — but also water, schools, things that can alleviate storms’ impact. That really is key, because as much as we silo things into these 17 categories, we do emphasize that infrastructure is all interlinked, and events like Texas put that at the forefront.”,Biden’s proposal offers a framework, but he will have to work with Congress to write the legislation. Last year the Democratically controlled House trotted out a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill, the Moving Forward Act, elements of which could wind up in a final bill. It included hundreds of billions of dollars for repairing roads and bridges, funding other transit projects, making improvements to school buildings, constructing affordable housing and enhancing broadband access.,Parts of other bills floating around the House could also wind up in the final package, including the ,, which would lay out a plan to eliminate fossil fuels from the United States’ electricity supply by 2035, and the ,, which seeks to stabilize Amtrak’s funding by creating a trust fund.,Although both Democratic and Republican leaders have expressed support for a major infrastructure project, it’s not yet clear that Biden’s push will get any backing from Republicans.,The president has said that he will pay for it by raising taxes on corporations and on Americans making more than $400,000 a year, a proposal that Republicans are unlikely to get behind. One big advantage for Biden: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the most conservative Democrat in the chamber, has said that he supports making large-scale investments in infrastructure.,But there’s also one big possible hangup: Manchin, more than almost any other influential Democrat, has a strong desire for bipartisan compromise and could balk at a proposal that fails to garner any Republican support.,“I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them and what they have to say, and be open to other ideas,” Biden said today. “We’ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done — but we have to get it done.”"

It also spared Democratic leaders from having to weigh in on whether to throw out the results of a contested vote months after President Donald J. Trump’s false claims of a stolen election fueled a partisan clash and a deadly riot at the Capitol.,Republicans had signaled that they were ready to turn the dispute into a political cudgel against the majority party, and some vulnerable Democrats who had come under attack on the issue in their districts were deeply uncomfortable with the prospect of intervening.,In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Hart repeated her claim that voters had been “silenced” but acknowledged that the contest had become politically contentious.,“Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,” she said. “It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed, and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility.”,Ms. Hart’s campaign had , that they believed were legally cast but “wrongfully” uncounted by state election officials during a districtwide recount in the fall. Rather than taking her case to court in Iowa before the election was certified, Ms. Hart opted to wait and appeal the results to the House Administration Committee, invoking a 1960s law.,With Democrats in control of the chamber, they would have run the review and had the power to order their own recount and a vote by the full House on whether to unseat Ms. Miller-Meeks in favor of their own candidate, which would have added to their eight-seat majority.,“I’m deeply appreciative that we’re ending this now,” Ms. Miller-Meeks said in a recorded statement on Wednesday evening. “It’s time to move forward, to unite as one group of people supporting Iowa’s Second Congressional District.”,Democratic leaders had argued that they were obliged to take the appeal seriously, but Republicans mobilized, accusing them of hypocrisy and trying to steal an election that had been verified by state officials. To drive home the point, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, flew to Iowa on Wednesday before Ms. Hart’s announcement to rail against what he called an attempted political power grab intended to pad Democrats’ margin of control.,“Iowans made a decision,” Mr. McCarthy said. “And it’s their voice, and they have a right to have Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who they elected, to continue to serve them.”,The dispute was a particularly tricky issue for politically vulnerable House Democrats, who have become targets of a coordinated pressure campaign on the matter. Republicans’ campaign arm found that , for them in the competitive districts they hope to flip in 2022.,The National Republican Congressional Committee specifically targeted Representative Cindy Axne, Democrat of Iowa, releasing , accusing her of being complicit in an attempt to overturn the will of the state’s voters.,An affiliated political action committee, American Action Network, announced last week that it would “spend mid-five figures on phone calls” in swing districts held by Democrats urging voters to oppose Ms. Hart’s efforts."

Seeks Trump Insider’s Records, in Apparent Bid to Gain Cooperation","State prosecutors in Manhattan investigating former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization have subpoenaed the personal bank records of the company’s chief financial officer and are questioning gifts he and his family received from Mr. Trump, according to people with knowledge of the matter.,In recent weeks, the prosecutors have , on the executive, Allen H. Weisselberg, in what appears to be a determined effort to gain his cooperation. Mr. Weisselberg, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has overseen the Trump Organization’s finances for decades and may hold the key to any possible criminal case in New York against the former president and his family business.,Prosecutors working for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., are examining, among other things, whether Mr. Trump and the company falsely manipulated property values to obtain loans and tax benefits.,It is unclear whether Mr. Weisselberg would cooperate with the investigation and neither his lawyer, Mary E. Mulligan, nor Mr. Vance’s office would comment. But if a review of his personal finances were to uncover possible wrongdoing, prosecutors could then use that information to press Mr. Weisselberg to guide them through the inner workings of the company. The 73-year-old accountant began his career working for Mr. Trump’s father.,Separately, the prosecutors are also seeking a new round of internal documents from the Trump Organization, including general ledgers from several of its more than two dozen properties that the company did not turn over last year, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.,The ledgers offer a line-by-line breakdown of each property’s financial situation, including daily receipts, checks and revenues. The prosecutors could compare those details against the information the company provided to its lenders and local tax authorities to assess whether it fraudulently misled them.,Mr. Vance’s office has also subpoenaed records from several banks where Mr. Trump or his company had accounts, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, according to people with knowledge of subpoenas served on the banks.,The previously unreported developments underscore the escalation of the investigation after Mr. Vance’s office obtained Mr. Trump’s tax records and other underlying financial documents in February. They were released over Mr. Trump’s objections after a lengthy legal battle that culminated in a ,.,The Trump Organization declined to comment. In the past, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and has slammed the investigation as a long-running and politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Mr. Vance, a Democrat, recently announced that ,.,The investigation has centered on some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent properties: Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the Trump hotels in New York and Chicago and the ,. In addition to possible tax- and bank-related fraud, the prosecutors are examining the Trump Organization’s statements to insurance companies about the value of various assets.,Prosecutors have subpoenaed records from a firm hired by Deutsche Bank, one of the former president’s main lenders, to assess the value of three Trump hotels with Deutsche Bank loans, people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm reviewed the operations of restaurants, bars and gift shops at the hotels, one of the people said.,Last year, the prosecutors , Deutsche Bank itself and Mr. Trump’s other main lender, Ladder Capital, which sold its Trump Organization loans years ago. Both banks are cooperating with the prosecutors.,It is unclear whether the prosecutors will ultimately file any charges. But if a case were built against the Trump Organization based on the loan documents, the company’s lawyers could argue that Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital are sophisticated financial institutions that conducted their own analysis of Mr. Trump’s properties without relying on the company’s internal assessments. The lawyers could also emphasize that providing different valuations for a property depending on the situation — for example, on a loan application or in appealing local property taxes — is common and appropriate in New York’s real estate industry, in part because there are varying methods for calculating property values.,Outside accountants also vet the information provided to local tax authorities, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraud. Mr. Trump has argued that his tax returns “were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S.”,In addition to the fraud investigation, Mr. Vance’s office continues to focus on its original target: the Trump Organization’s role in paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.,Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 to buy the silence of one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who performed as Stormy Daniels. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Vance’s office has scrutinized whether the company properly accounted for the $130,000 payment.,Mr. Cohen, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges for his role in the hush-money scheme, has long implicated Mr. Weisselberg, alleging that he helped devise a strategy to mask the reimbursements. The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen did not accuse Mr. Weisselberg of wrongdoing.,Mr. Cohen is now cooperating with Mr. Vance’s investigation and has met with prosecutors several times, including to review some of Mr. Trump’s financial documents. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.,The prosecutors have also questioned Mr. Weisselberg’s former daughter-in-law, Jennifer Weisselberg, she has said. Ms. Weisselberg has been enmeshed in a bitter divorce with Mr. Weisselberg’s son, Barry, who manages the Trump Wollman Rink in Central Park.,Ms. Weisselberg said in an interview that prosecutors have asked her about a number of gifts that Mr. Trump and his company gave the Weisselberg family over the years. These include an apartment on Central Park South for Ms. Weisselberg and her former husband, cars leased for several family members and private school tuition.,The scrutiny of the gifts appears to be part of an effort to paint a picture of Mr. Weisselberg’s financial life, as is common when prosecutors seek cooperation from a potential witness. It is unclear whether prosecutors suspect any wrongdoing related to the gifts.,James B. Stewart, and ,Steve Eder, contributed reporting. ,Susan C. Beachy, contributed research."

Trump on Tuesday, saying he was responsible for the physical and emotional injuries they had suffered as a result of the day’s events.,Supporters of Mr. Trump overran the Capitol as Congress was certifying Joe Biden’s victory over Mr. Trump in the November presidential election. Before the incursion, Mr. Trump ,, where he urged his supporters to “show strength” and “fight like hell.”,Five people, including a ,, died in the mayhem. Mr. Trump was later impeached by the House of Representatives on a single charge of “incitement of insurrection,” but was , after a brief Senate trial in which few Republicans broke ranks to vote guilty.,The Capitol Police officers who sued Mr. Trump, James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby, filed , in the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia, and are each seeking compensatory damages in excess of $75,000, plus punitive damages.,The lawsuit is the first to be brought against the former president by Capitol Police officers. The force has more than 2,000 officers.,Lawyers for the officers and for Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment early Wednesday. Mr. Trump has previously denied responsibility for the attack.,The complaint said the “insurrectionist mob” that stormed the Capitol was “spurred on by Trump’s conduct over many months in getting his followers to believe” his , in November. The complaint also said that Mr. Trump’s supporters believed swarming the Capitol was their last chance to stop Mr. Trump from being unfairly forced out of the White House.,Mr. Trump “inflamed, encouraged, incited, directed, and aided and abetted” the mob that overran the building and attacked police personnel inside, the complaint said. It cited Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6 speech and other conduct, including what it said was his failure that day to “take timely action to stop his followers from continued violence.”,During the attack, Officer Hemby, an 11-year veteran of the Capitol Police, was outside the building, crushed against the side and sprayed with chemicals that burned his eyes, skin and throat, the complaint said. One member of the mob screamed that he was “disrespecting the badge.”,Officer Hemby remains in physical therapy for neck and back injuries that he sustained on Jan. 6 and “has struggled to manage the emotional fallout from being relentlessly attacked,” according to the complaint.,Officer Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, suffered head and back injuries during the riot, the complaint said, and experienced back pain, depression and insomnia afterward.,“He is haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts — the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface,” the complaint said. “He experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked; and of surviving where other colleagues did not.”,The Capitol and Metropolitan Police departments have said that a total of ,. The injuries ranged from minor bruises to concussions, rib fractures, burns and even a mild heart attack."

Inquiry Over Sex With an Underage Girl,"Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida and a close ally of former President Donald J. Trump, is being investigated by the Justice Department over whether he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her to travel with him, according to three people briefed on the matter.,Investigators are examining whether Mr. Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, the people said. A variety of federal statutes make it illegal to induce someone under 18 to travel over state lines to engage in sex in exchange for money or something of value. The Justice Department regularly prosecutes such cases, and offenders often receive severe sentences.,It was not clear how Mr. Gaetz met the girl, believed to be 17 at the time of encounters about two years ago that investigators are scrutinizing, according to two of the people.,The investigation was opened in the final months of the Trump administration under Attorney General William P. Barr, the two people said. Given Mr. Gaetz’s national profile, senior Justice Department officials in Washington — including some appointed by Mr. Trump — were notified of the investigation, the people said.,The three people said that the examination of Mr. Gaetz, 38, is part of a broader investigation into a political ally of his, a local official in Florida named Joel Greenberg, who was indicted last summer on ,, , sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex, at least one of whom was an underage girl.,Mr. Greenberg, who has since resigned his post as tax collector in Seminole County, north of Orlando, visited the White House with Mr. Gaetz in 2019, ,.,No charges have been brought against Mr. Gaetz, and the extent of his criminal exposure is unclear.,Mr. Gaetz said in an interview that his lawyers had been in touch with the Justice Department and that they were told he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. “I only know that it has to do with women,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.”,Mr. Gaetz called the investigation part of an elaborate scheme involving “false sex allegations” to extort him and his family for $25 million that began this month. He said he and his father, Don Gaetz, had been cooperating with the F.B.I. and “wearing a wire” after they were approached by people saying they could make the investigation “go away.” Mr. Gaetz claimed the disclosure of the sex trafficking inquiry was intended to thwart an investigation into the extortion plot.,In a second interview later Tuesday, the congressman said he had no plans to resign his House seat and denied that he had romantic relationships with minors. “It is verifiably false that I have traveled with a 17-year-old woman,” he said.,Representatives for the Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Central Florida.,Mr. Greenberg pleaded not guilty last year and was sent to jail this month for violating the terms of his bail. He is scheduled to go on trial in June in Orlando.,A frequent presence on Fox News and other conservative media, Mr. Gaetz has recently mused with confidants about quitting elected politics and taking a full-time job with the conservative television channel Newsmax or another network, according to a person familiar with the conversations. Axios , on Tuesday that Mr. Gaetz was considering leaving Congress.,Mr. Greenberg maintained ties to controversial figures who have supported Mr. Trump, an examination of court records, social media posts and far-right websites showed. A website run by a member of the far-right group the Proud Boys and a network of fake social media accounts linked to Mr. Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. have promoted false accusations about Mr. Greenberg’s rivals similar to rumors that prosecutors accused Mr. Greenberg of secretly trying to spread.,It was not clear how Mr. Greenberg knew either Mr. Gaetz or Mr. Stone. He posted a selfie with both in 2017, ,, “Great catching up.” The following year, Mr. Gaetz expressed support for Mr. Greenberg’s successful bid for local office, predicting he would someday make a great member of Congress.,On Capitol Hill, Mr. Gaetz has , to the left as much as he has served as one of Mr. Trump’s staunchest defenders and enablers, often with theatrical flair. He wore a gas mask on the House floor last year in the early days of the pandemic, insisting he was demonstrating concern for public safety amid accusations he was mocking the seriousness of the spread of the coronavirus.,Mr. Gaetz was first elected to Congress in 2016. As a member of the Florida State Legislature and the scion of a Republican political family, he had initially backed former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in the Republican presidential primary that year before hitching his political fortunes to Mr. Trump.,It paid off. He won a seat in Congress representing part of the Florida Panhandle, and as one of Mr. Trump’s most flamboyant supporters on Capitol Hill and on cable television, his profile skyrocketed.,Mr. Gaetz invited a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union address in 2018, and attended an event last year where ,, though he has distanced himself from the group on his podcast. When Democrats moved in 2019 to ,, Mr. Gaetz and a phalanx of Republicans following him , to briefly break up the investigation into the president.,After Mr. Trump’s defeat last year, Mr. Gaetz once again rallied to his side, defending the president’s baseless claims of widespread election fraud. Mr. Gaetz , during Congress’s certification of it on Jan. 6 that was disrupted for hours by a pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol. Mr. Gaetz later traveled to Wyoming to hold a rally against Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican leader who had ,.,In 2017, Mr. Gaetz was the only member of Congress to vote against a law that gave the federal government more power and money to fight human trafficking.,“Voters in Northwest Florida did not send me to Washington to go and create more federal government,” Mr. Gaetz said in a local television interview at the time. “If anything, we should be abolishing a lot of the agencies at the federal level.”,Mr. Gaetz’s personal life has gained attention before. Last summer, he announced that he had a son, Nestor Galban, 19, though Mr. Gaetz said he was not Mr. Galban’s biological father, nor had he adopted him. Mr. Galban had been 12 when they met and had come to the United States from Cuba; Mr. Gaetz was at the time dating Mr. Galban’s sister.,“He is a part of my family story,” Mr. Gaetz , in June. “My work with Nestor, our family, no element of my public service could compare to the joy that our family has brought me.”,Mr. Gaetz is now , to an analyst named Ginger Luckey, 26, whom he , at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club on Dec. 30.,It was unclear how investigators in the Greenberg case began examining Mr. Gaetz’s conduct. Last June, federal prosecutors secured , against Mr. Greenberg, accusing him of stalking a political rival.,Around that time, federal authorities seized Mr. Greenberg’s phone and laptop, according to court records. They discovered evidence that Mr. Greenberg, whose job responsibilities included issuing licenses, was creating fake identification cards for himself and a teenage girl, and was experimenting with holograms used on permits for concealed firearms, according to court documents.,Two months later, , on the sex trafficking charge. From May to November 2017, prosecutors said, Mr. Greenberg targeted the girl, who was between 14 and 17, saying he “recruited” and “solicited” her for sex acts in exchange for unspecified perks or favors.,Mr. Greenberg worked in advertising before running successfully at the age of 31 in 2016 for tax collector in Seminole County.,Within days of taking office, he fired three employees who had supported his predecessor and began spending more than $1.5 million in taxpayer money on personal expenses, including guns, ammunition, body armor and a drone, as well as on computers for his own cryptocurrency venture, a county audit later revealed.,The following year, ,, Mr. Greenberg posted a photograph of himself on social media with Milo Yiannopoulos, a right-wing personality who has a history of making racist remarks. The newspaper also detailed Mr. Greenberg’s own misogynist and anti-Muslim comments on Facebook.,In his bid for re-election, Mr. Greenberg turned in late 2019 to clandestine tactics to undermine a possible rival, according to court papers. Prosecutors said he sent an anonymous letter to the school where one potential candidate worked that made unfounded accusations of sexual misconduct with a student and making similar claims on a fake Facebook account.,As the primary race intensified last summer, similar messaging began appearing on fake social media accounts that have been tied to Mr. Stone.,“Watch out Seminole county,” said someone named April Goad on Facebook, warning Floridians “don’t open your door” to the rival candidate, according to Graphika, a company that specializes in analyzing social media.,The post linked to an article about the rival published on Central Florida Post, a website controlled by Mr. Stone’s associates that had written favorable articles about Mr. Greenberg.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/transgender-troops-military.html,Pentagon Issues New Rules Overturning Trump’s Ban on Transgender Troops,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday erased a Trump-era ban on transgender people serving in the military, issuing new rules that would offer them access to gender transition care and medical services denied under the Trump administration.,The sweeping guidelines allow transgender people to enlist and serve openly as the gender they identify with and receive medically necessary care authorized by law. They also prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity.,The change follows , , that restored protections put in place during the Obama administration that had opened the ranks of the armed services to transgender people. The order gave the Defense Department 60 days to evaluate the guidelines.,The Pentagon announced the shift on the same day that Mr. Biden proclaimed a transgender “day of visibility.” , and , posted on Twitter that “transgender rights are human rights” and called for Americans to stamp out discrimination against transgender people.,Advocates for the reversal of the ban were elated.,“We have consistently said that restoring a policy of full inclusion for transgender troops would be straightforward,” Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, said in a statement. “This is a big step toward making our military stronger and fairer, and it recognizes years of research showing that a single standard for all service members improves readiness and allows for the widest possible pool of qualified personnel.”,John F. Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said during a news conference that the Defense Department would “lead by example” on the issue of transgender rights.,An estimated 1,000 to 8,000 service members identify as transgender, Stephanie Miller, the director of the Pentagon’s Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, said at the news conference, though Defense Department officials acknowledge that number is imprecise and could be higher. She also said that the estimated costs for medical treatment for transgender troops, which President Donald J. Trump cited as a reason for ,, would be “a handful of a million dollars” per year.,“The Pentagon absolutely did the right thing today by re-establishing a policy of inclusion for transgender service members, who once again will be able to serve openly and proudly in their self-identified gender,” Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.,While the move was expected, the swiftness with which it happened signaled a willingness by the Biden administration to put its stamp on social issues at the Defense Department. The Pentagon has also been looking at how the military has handled sexual assault issues.,Mr. Biden and Defense Department leaders are also wrestling with a reckoning on race at the Pentagon, where officials have had to confront a stark fact: Close to one in five of those arrested in connection with breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6 have ties to the military, and many have ,.,After the attack, the Pentagon has held a series of sessions to address extremist and white supremacist groups in the military. One of the first things Lloyd J. Austin III did after becoming the defense secretary was to order a servicewide “stand down” to address extremism in the ranks. The term refers to an issue — in the past it was safety or sexual assault or suicide — that the secretary has decided is important enough that it needs to be addressed through discussions with troops worldwide."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/climate/biden-climate-jobs.html,"Biden’s Big Bet: Tackling Climate Change Will Create Jobs, Not Kill Them","WASHINGTON — In 2017, as Donald J. Trump was announcing the ,, the largest global effort to attack planetary warming, he declared, “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”,On Wednesday, President Biden traveled to Pittsburgh to try to make the opposite case: that the workers Mr. Trump was appealing to have more to gain from combating climate change than to lose.,It is going to be a tough bet. To Mr. Biden, a , is about creating union jobs, hundreds of thousands of them, in wind and solar power, electric cars and road- and bridge-building. Even those more basic infrastructure projects would have a climate angle: the new roads and bridges would be built to withstand the high waters and brutal storms of a changing climate.,“I am a union guy. I support unions, unions built the middle class. It is about time you start to get a piece of the action,” Mr. Biden said in Pittsburgh.,He promised “good paying jobs” for “American workers” making “American products.”,That is not a new pitch. For decades, Democrats have insisted “jobs versus the environment” is a false choice. But in the scale of his proposal and the audacity of his promises, Mr. Biden may be laying his political future on that idea.,He faces a lot of skepticism.,In Michigan, a state critical to the president’s political future, autoworkers know it takes fewer of them to build an electric car. Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat whose vote could again decide the package’s fate, understands coal miners in his state would earn considerably less putting up wind turbines.,And in Pennsylvania, which put Mr. Biden over the top in November, and then hosted his speech on Wednesday, some union workers don’t see how skills honed over decades in fossil fuel industries would translate in a clean-energy future.,“They keep saying, ‘We’re going to transition you into solar jobs.’ That’s not how it works,” said Shawn Steffee, a leader of the Boilermakers Local 154 in Pittsburgh. “We build power plants, petrochemical plants and maintain steel mills.”,He asked, “Would you ask Tom Brady to play middle linebacker just because he’s a football player?”,Union leaders — some of whom switched from supporting Mr. Trump in 2016 to Mr. Biden in 2020 — say that for now, they will work with him to realize his vision of conquering climate change, even as it transforms their workplaces.,But they are skeptical that the well-paying union jobs the president promises will materialize, noting that, so far, the ecosystem of manufacturers, contractors and utility developers that has grown up around the green economy has often been low-paying and hostile to unions.,“The president’s new mantra is ‘Build Back Better’ with good union jobs that have good wages, and not just wages but representation,” said Joe Davis, the state political coordinator for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Michigan. “But these companies seem to be resistant to that.”,And Republicans are ready to try to win back the union votes that Mr. Trump won, then lost. “Rather than picking winners and losers with pie-the-sky Green New Deal mandates, we should be embracing an all-the-above energy strategy,” Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, said Wednesday.,No industry may have more to gain — or lose — from Mr. Biden’s climate plan than America’s automakers, which currently employ about a million workers. The president’s infrastructure plan proposes $174 billion to encourage the manufacture and purchase of electric cars, which today make up just 2 percent of the vehicles on America’s highways.,He envisions a not-too-distant future in which nearly half of the middle-class drives affordable union-made cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles that produce zero fossil-fuel pollution, powered by millions of electric vehicle charging stations, all jump-started by his stimulus spending.,From a climate perspective, the plan makes sense. Fossil fuel emissions from vehicle tailpipes are the leading cause of planet-warming pollution in United States. Replacing gas-guzzlers on the road with electric vehicles could be one of the most effective ways to lower the nation’s emissions.,From a job-creation perspective, it’s more complicated. On the one hand, it takes about one-third fewer workers to build an electric car than a car with an internal combustion engine. On the other, the plan could make Detroit more competitive and increase its share of the global automobile market.,Mr. Biden’s proposed solution is to lure the electric-battery industry, and its supply chain, to the United States from China and elsewhere in Asia, with a mix of manufacturing tax credits and other incentives. If it works, the next two years would see new electric vehicle battery and assembly plants sprouting up across the country. If it fails, Mr. Biden could face harsh political repercussions.,“We can make it work, but we have to be intentional about policy to bring the battery supply chain back to the U.S.,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat whose Detroit-area district is home to some of the nation’s largest auto plants. She added, “If they’re in China and Asia, this isn’t going to be OK.”,Some industry analysts say as Americans buy more electric vehicles, battery manufacturers will build plants in the United States. That would make it easier to integrate the batteries into cars and helps save on transportation costs.,But even with new plants much of the work can happen outside of the United States. According to a , by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and BloombergNEF, an energy research group, only 46 percent of the value of a Tesla battery assembled in the United States comes from this country. The rest comes from Japan and China.,Mr. Biden’s energy plan would also dedicate $100 billion to update and modernize the electricity grid to make it more reliable and better able to route power from wind and solar plants to large cities. Mr. Biden would also extend tax credits that subsidize investments in wind and solar energy.,Accelerating the shift to wind and solar power is likely to create tens of thousands of construction jobs, economists and industry officials say. But those jobs typically pay far less than those in the fossil fuel industry.,Anthony Prisco, the head of the renewable energy practice for the staffing firm Aerotek, said a standard solar project will employ about 250 workers for just under a year. About one-third of the workers,make $30 an hour or more; the other two-thirds have fewer skills and make hourly wages of less than $20.,By contrast, the construction of a gas-powered electricity plant typically lasts two to three years and employs hundreds of skilled, unionized tradesmen — electricians, pipe-fitters and boilermakers — who make $75,000 a year or more, including benefits.,“When you’re talking about the transition to the new green economy, the first question has got to be how are people going to make a horizontal economic move,” said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, in an interview last month. “I can tell you that in the onshore wind and solar industry, for my members we’re talking in some cases a 75 percent pay cut and they’re losing benefits.”,Jim Harrison, the director of renewable energy for the Utility Workers Union of America, said that it typically takes hundreds of workers to operate and maintain a nuclear or coal plant, several dozen at a gas plant — and about a dozen at a wind farm. Solar fields can often operate without a single worker on-site.,Mr. Biden has acknowledged that his plans could leave around 130,000 oil, gas and coal workers without their livelihoods. He included a $16 billion program to help fossil fuel workers transition to new work like capping leaks on defunct oil wells and shutting down retired coal mines.,The fossil fuel industry, while generally supportive of capping abandoned wells, contends that Mr. Biden is overstating the job opportunities.,“It’s something oil and gas workers could do. They’re already experts at it, and they would be union jobs,” said Frank Maisano, a partner at Bracewell, LLP, which represents oil and gas companies. “But there are a lot of oil and gas workers, and there aren’t enough of those wells.,Still, whatever their concerns, union officials have , about the Biden plan, particularly its large investment in traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges. “These investments can restore our economic well-being and create hundreds of thousands of good union jobs,” said Terry O’Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, in a statement.,In Pittsburgh, a former steel town that has transformed into a hub for high tech and medicine, leaders have made clear they support clean energy development. But in other parts of Western Pennsylvania, union workers closely tied to fossil fuel industries had reservations.,“I don’t see solar or wind creating as many jobs as we get from petrochemical plants, cryogenic plants or coal fired power plants,” said Kenneth Broadbent, business manager of the Steamfitters Local 449 in Pittsburgh, who endorsed President Biden.,“There’s no stopping electric cars,” Mr. Broadbent said. But, he added, “You’re not going to see natural gas and coal and nuclear be phased out as quickly as people would like.”,A , under construction in Beaver County, northwest of Pittsburgh, employs 2,700 workers from the steamfitters union. Mr. Biden’s plan, if passed, may create jobs, Mr. Broadbent said, but it won’t be a “godsend” like the petrochemical industry has been."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/biden-electric-vehicles-infrastructure.html,"Biden’s Push for Electric Cars: $174 Billion, 10 Years and a Bit of Luck","President Biden is a muscle-car guy — one of his , that he got from his father. But he’s trying to make this an electric vehicle world.,The , that he , is aimed at tackling climate change in part by spending up to $174 billion to encourage Americans to switch to cars and trucks that run on electricity, not gasoline or diesel. That is a large investment but it might not be enough to push most Americans toward E.V.s.,Despite rapid growth in recent years, electric vehicles remain a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks on the road. They have been slow to take off in large part because they can cost up to $10,000 more than similar conventional cars and trucks. Charging E.V.s is also more difficult and slower than simply refilling the tank at far more prevalent gas stations.,Mr. Biden hopes to address many of those challenges through federal largess. He aims to lower the cost of electric vehicles by offering individuals, businesses and governments tax credits, rebates and other incentives. To address the chicken-and-egg problem of getting people to try a new technology before it is widely accepted, he hopes to build half a million chargers by 2030 so people will feel confident that they won’t be stranded when they run out of juice. And he is offering help to automakers to get them to build electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.,“We find ourselves at a unique moment here where most American businesses and many states are looking toward a decarbonized future, but recognize there’s a big lift on the infrastructure side,” said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental research group. “This investment alone obviously won’t solve the climate problem or fix all of the infrastructure in the United States but it will be a huge boost.”,Automakers see the writing on the wall and many, including ,. But even they acknowledge that they will need federal help.,“This transformation is greater than any one policy, branch or level of government, or industry sector,” a group representing ,. “It will require a sustained holistic approach with a broad range of legislative and regulatory policies rooted in economic, social, environmental and cultural realities.”,The letter called for grants, loans, tax credits and tax deductions to promote research and manufacturing. The authors of the letter, which included industry groups and the United Auto Workers union, called for investment in job training programs and federal help in promoting development of minerals and other raw materials in the United States.,But production is only one piece of the puzzle. The transition away from gas-powered vehicles rests on convincing consumers of the benefits of electric vehicles. That hasn’t been easy because the cars have higher sticker prices even though researchers say that they cost less to own. Electricity is cheaper on a per mile basis than gasoline, and E.V.s require less routine maintenance — there is no oil to change — than combustion-engine cars.,The single biggest cost of an electric car comes from the battery, which can run about $15,000 for a midsize sedan. That cost has been dropping and is widely expected to keep falling thanks to manufacturing improvements and technical advancements. But some scholars believe that a major technological breakthrough will be required to make electric cars much, much cheaper.,“There’s a good sense that at least for the next maybe five years or so they’re going to keep declining, but then are they going to level off or are they going to keep declining?” Joshua Linn, a professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, an environmental nonprofit, said about battery costs. “That won’t be enough, so then that’s given rise to a lot of attention to infrastructure.”,The federal government and some states already offer tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of electric cars. But the main such federal incentive — a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of new electric cars — begins to phase out for cars once an automaker has sold 200,000 E.V.s. Buyers of Tesla and G.M. electric cars, for example, no longer qualify for that tax credit but buyers of Ford and Volkswagen electric cars do.,Mr. Biden described his incentives for electric car purchases as rebates available at the “point of sale,” presumably meaning at dealerships or while ordering cars online. But the administration has not released details about how big those rebates will be and which vehicles they would apply to.,Another big concern is charging. People with dedicated parking spots typically charge their E.V.s overnight at home, but many people who live in apartments or have to drive longer distances need to use public charging stations, which are still greatly outnumbered by gas stations.,“The top three reasons consumers give for not buying E.V.s are lack of charging stations, time to charge, and the cost of E.V.s,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “They seem to be really emphasizing all three. So, over all, it looks very promising.”,There are ,, most with multiple pumps. Mr. Biden’s plan calls for a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers within the decade, up from , with more than 100,000 outlets today, according to the Energy Department.,“One of the things that needs to be addressed is getting chargers into places where people only have on-street parking, like in cities and urban areas where you don’t have a driveway or garage,” Mr. Abuelsamid said. “If they can address that, it will make E.V.s available to a lot more people.”,The government in China, which leads the world in the use of electric cars, has done much more than the United States to speed up the installation of chargers.,“It is, famously, one of the ways that China has become the No. 1 country in E.V.s on most dimensions,” John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email.,Even with incentives for manufacturers, a robust charging network and a willing public, the transition to electric cars may take a few decades. Carmakers have improved vehicle reliability in recent years, so many cars stay on the road a long time. The average age of cars and light trucks in the United States ,, up from 9.6 years in 2002, according to IHS Markit, an economic forecasting firm.,Neal E. Boudette, contributed reporting."

Seeks Trump Insider’s Records, in Apparent Bid to Gain Cooperation","State prosecutors in Manhattan investigating former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization have subpoenaed the personal bank records of the company’s chief financial officer and are questioning gifts he and his family received from Mr. Trump, according to people with knowledge of the matter.,In recent weeks, the prosecutors have , on the executive, Allen H. Weisselberg, in what appears to be a determined effort to gain his cooperation. Mr. Weisselberg, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has overseen the Trump Organization’s finances for decades and may hold the key to any possible criminal case in New York against the former president and his family business.,Prosecutors working for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., are examining, among other things, whether Mr. Trump and the company falsely manipulated property values to obtain loans and tax benefits.,It is unclear whether Mr. Weisselberg would cooperate with the investigation and neither his lawyer, Mary E. Mulligan, nor Mr. Vance’s office would comment. But if a review of his personal finances were to uncover possible wrongdoing, prosecutors could then use that information to press Mr. Weisselberg to guide them through the inner workings of the company. The 73-year-old accountant began his career working for Mr. Trump’s father.,Separately, the prosecutors are also seeking a new round of internal documents from the Trump Organization, including general ledgers from several of its more than two dozen properties that the company did not turn over last year, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.,The ledgers offer a line-by-line breakdown of each property’s financial situation, including daily receipts, checks and revenues. The prosecutors could compare those details against the information the company provided to its lenders and local tax authorities to assess whether it fraudulently misled them.,Mr. Vance’s office has also subpoenaed records from several banks where Mr. Trump or his company had accounts, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, according to people with knowledge of subpoenas served on the banks.,The previously unreported developments underscore the escalation of the investigation after Mr. Vance’s office obtained Mr. Trump’s tax records and other underlying financial documents in February. They were released over Mr. Trump’s objections after a lengthy legal battle that culminated in a ,.,The Trump Organization declined to comment. In the past, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and has slammed the investigation as a long-running and politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Mr. Vance, a Democrat, recently announced that ,.,The investigation has centered on some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent properties: Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the Trump hotels in New York and Chicago and the ,. In addition to possible tax- and bank-related fraud, the prosecutors are examining the Trump Organization’s statements to insurance companies about the value of various assets.,Prosecutors have subpoenaed records from a firm hired by Deutsche Bank, one of the former president’s main lenders, to assess the value of three Trump hotels with Deutsche Bank loans, people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm reviewed the operations of restaurants, bars and gift shops at the hotels, one of the people said.,Last year, the prosecutors , Deutsche Bank itself and Mr. Trump’s other main lender, Ladder Capital, which sold its Trump Organization loans years ago. Both banks are cooperating with the prosecutors.,It is unclear whether the prosecutors will ultimately file any charges. But if a case were built against the Trump Organization based on the loan documents, the company’s lawyers could argue that Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital are sophisticated financial institutions that conducted their own analysis of Mr. Trump’s properties without relying on the company’s internal assessments. The lawyers could also emphasize that providing different valuations for a property depending on the situation — for example, on a loan application or in appealing local property taxes — is common and appropriate in New York’s real estate industry, in part because there are varying methods for calculating property values.,Outside accountants also vet the information provided to local tax authorities, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraud. Mr. Trump has argued that his tax returns “were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S.”,In addition to the fraud investigation, Mr. Vance’s office continues to focus on its original target: the Trump Organization’s role in paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.,Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 to buy the silence of one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who performed as Stormy Daniels. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Vance’s office has scrutinized whether the company properly accounted for the $130,000 payment.,Mr. Cohen, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges for his role in the hush-money scheme, has long implicated Mr. Weisselberg, alleging that he helped devise a strategy to mask the reimbursements. The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen did not accuse Mr. Weisselberg of wrongdoing.,Mr. Cohen is now cooperating with Mr. Vance’s investigation and has met with prosecutors several times, including to review some of Mr. Trump’s financial documents. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.,The prosecutors have also questioned Mr. Weisselberg’s former daughter-in-law, Jennifer Weisselberg, she has said. Ms. Weisselberg has been enmeshed in a bitter divorce with Mr. Weisselberg’s son, Barry, who manages the Trump Wollman Rink in Central Park.,Ms. Weisselberg said in an interview that prosecutors have asked her about a number of gifts that Mr. Trump and his company gave the Weisselberg family over the years. These include an apartment on Central Park South for Ms. Weisselberg and her former husband, cars leased for several family members and private school tuition.,The scrutiny of the gifts appears to be part of an effort to paint a picture of Mr. Weisselberg’s financial life, as is common when prosecutors seek cooperation from a potential witness. It is unclear whether prosecutors suspect any wrongdoing related to the gifts.,James B. Stewart, and ,Steve Eder, contributed reporting. ,Susan C. Beachy, contributed research."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/health/esophageal-cancer-nivolumab.html,A ‘Game Changer’ for Patients With Esophageal Cancer,"For decades, esophageal cancer has defied scientific attempts to discover a therapy that extends patients’ survival, year after year claiming the lives of such illustrious people as Humphrey Bogart, Christopher Hitchens and Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas.,Now a , offers hope, finding that a drug that unleashes the immune system to attack cancer cells can double the disease-free survival times in patients from 11 months to 22 months. The study was published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.,“It is a game changer,” said Dr. David Ilson, an esophageal cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who wrote , accompanying the research. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”,In the trial, sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb, 794 patients in 29 countries were randomly assigned to receive infusions of the drug, nivolumab, or a placebo.,The patients had all had chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery to remove their cancers. As usually happens, pathology reports showed that the surgery did not remove all of the cancer cells, which still lurked in lymph nodes and elsewhere, setting the stage in these patients for their cancers to return as incurable metastases.,Nivolumab is approved for some patients with other cancers, like Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma and colorectal cancer. With the new study, experts expect the drug will readily win approval for treatment of early-stage esophageal cancer.,Dr. Ronan Kelly, director of the Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor University Medical Center and lead author of the new study, said he and the other researchers urgently wanted to help the 75 percent of patients who go through extraordinarily difficult sequences of radiation, chemotherapy and surgery that disfigures the digestive system, only to learn that cancer is still present or has a high likelihood of recurring.,Without some other form of treatment, “we knew many would recur quickly,” Dr. Kelly said. Additional chemotherapy not only was difficult for patients to tolerate, but it also did not seem to help. Nivolumab has few side effects and seemed worth a try.,Esophageal cancer is rare in the United States, accounting for 1 percent of all cancers; about 15,000 patients die each year. But it is the seventh most common cancer globally, and frequently seen in East Asia, although it is not clear why, Dr. Ilson said.,Smoking is a risk factor, but researchers do not think the high smoking rates in China, for example, explain the high incidence. “We don’t think it’s environmental,” Dr. Ilson said.,Other risk factors include alcohol consumption and acid reflux disease.,Because the cancer is so rare in the United States, it has not gotten much research attention. While new treatments have revolutionized prospects for other cancer patients, those with esophageal cancer could only look on longingly.,That has weighed heavily on people with the disease, said Mindy Mordecai. Her husband, John, died of esophageal cancer in March 2008. She started an advocacy group called Esophageal Cancer Action Network.,“You can’t even imagine how demoralizing it is to see all the progress around you. ‘Please sir, may I have some more gruel?’” she said, quoting Oliver Twist, the Charles Dickens character in the eponymous novel, asking for a pittance.,The new findings must be seen in the context of what patients go through when they develop esophageal cancer, experts said. Most learn they have the cancer after it has progressed to a point where they are unlikely to survive.,But every patient hopes to be one of the lucky ones. “Our patients are always waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Ms. Mordecai said. “You have to understand what it’s like to live with that every day.”,The first step for most is chemotherapy and radiation. The treatment is so harsh that an oncology nurse told Mr. Mordecai it “brings Navy Seals to their knees,” Ms. Mordecai recalled.,The chemotherapy has difficult side effects, and the radiation causes a burning sensation that makes it difficult to swallow. “Food won’t go down,” Ms. Mordecai said. “You just feel rotten.”,The next step is major surgery. A doctor takes out most of the patient’s esophagus, the tract leading from the mouth to the stomach, and then grabs the stomach and pulls it up, attaching it to a stump of esophagus left behind.,The result is a stomach that is vertical, not horizontal, and lacks the sphincter muscle that normally keeps stomach acid from spilling out. For the rest of their lives, patients can never lie flat — if they do, the contents of their stomach, including acid, pours into their throats. They can choke, cough and aspirate.,Recovery is difficult, and morbidity and mortality are high. But most patients go through with the operation once they weigh their options. To refuse the treatment means giving up and letting the cancer close off the esophagus to the point where some cannot even swallow their own saliva, said Dr. Paul Helft, a professor of surgery and an ethicist at Indiana University School of Medicine.,The treatment is so long and harrowing that Dr. Helft often uses it to teach medical students and other trainees about informed consent — about how patients must be fully informed before they start any given treatment. Esophageal cancer patients in particular must be told that they are likely to have a recurrence within the first year.,Ms. Mordecai said her husband had his surgery at the end of September 2008. By Dec. 6, he had untreatable metastases in his liver. Now, she said, patients may have a glimmer of hope.,Dr. Ilson, who has spent his career trying to develop therapies to help patients with esophageal cancer, said that he did not expect this treatment to succeed: “We all get nihilistic when faced with years of negative studies.”,“This is really a landmark paper,” he added, and the drug “will become a new standard of care.”"

The plans include raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent. The corporate tax rate had been cut from 35 percent under former President Donald J. Trump.,The Business Roundtable said it supported infrastructure investment, calling it “essential to economic growth” and important “to ensure a rapid economic recovery” — but rejected corporate tax increases as a way to pay for it.,Policymakers should avoid creating new barriers to job creation and economic growth, particularly during the recovery,” the group’s chief executive, Joshua Bolten, ,.,The U.S. Chamber of Commerce echoed that view. “We strongly oppose the general tax increases proposed by the administration, which will slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally — the exact opposite of the goals of the infrastructure plan,” the chamber’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, ,.,The president’s focus on the work force will help the economy as it recovers from the pandemic-induced slowdown, the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, said in a statement. But, it added, the proposed tax increase would hurt the country’s competitive advantage.,“Raising taxes on manufacturers would fundamentally undermine our ability to lead this recovery,” the trade group said., since the presidential election and has hoped that gridlock in Washington would moderate Mr. Biden’s agenda. On Wednesday, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, believed “that the corporate tax rate for companies in the U.S. has to be competitive globally, which it is now.”,But “he has no problem with high-income people like himself paying a higher tax rate,” said the spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti.,The Biden administration has indicated that , for wealthy Americans will help fund the second phase of the infrastructure plan, which is expected to be announced next month and will focus on priorities like education, health care and paid leave. The increase in corporate taxes is an effort to “ensure that corporations pay their fair share,” White House officials said ,."

But today, thanks in part to the work of Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman, practically anyone can use a computer and program it to perform new tasks.,On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, said Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman would receive this year’s Turing Award for their work on the fundamental concepts that underpin computer programming languages. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize, which the two academics and longtime friends will split.,Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman helped refine one of the key components of a computer: the “compiler” that ,.,Over the past five decades, computer scientists have built increasingly intuitive programming languages, making it easier and easier for people to create software for desktops, laptops, smartphones, cars and even supercomputers. Compilers ensure that these languages are efficiently translated into the ones and zeros that computers understand.,Without their work, “we would not be able to write an app for our phones,” said Krysta Svore, a researcher at Microsoft who studied with Dr. Aho at Columbia University, where he was chairman of the computer science department. “We would not have the cars we drive these days.”,The researchers also wrote many textbooks and taught generations of students as they defined how computer software development was different from electrical engineering or mathematics.,“Their fingerprints are all over the field,” said Graydon Hoare, the creator of a programming language called Rust. He added that two of Dr. Ullman’s books were sitting on the shelf beside him.,After leaving Princeton, both Dr. Aho, a Canadian by birth who is 79, and Dr. Ullman, a native New Yorker who is 78, joined the New Jersey headquarters of Bell Labs, which was then one of the world’s leading research labs.,Dr. Ullman, now professor emeritus at Stanford University, was also instrumental in developing the languages and concepts that drive databases, the software for storing and retrieving information that is essential to everything from the Google search engine to the applications used by office workers across the globe.,The ideas cultivated by Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman are even a part of the computers of the future. At Microsoft, Dr. Svore is working on quantum computers, experimental machines that , exhibited by things like electrons or exotic metals cooled to several hundred degrees below zero.,Quantum computers rely on a completely different kind of physical behavior from traditional computers. But as they create programming languages for these machines, Dr. Svore and her colleagues are still drawing on the work of the latest Turing winners.,“We are building on the same techniques,” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/voting-rights-georgia-corporations.html,Black Executives Call on Corporations to Fight Restrictive Voting Laws,"Dozens of the most prominent Black business leaders in America are banding together to call on companies to fight a wave of restrictive voting bills being advanced by Republicans in at least 43 states. The campaign appears to be the first time that so many powerful Black executives have organized to directly call out their peers for failing to stand up for racial justice.,The effort, led by Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express, and Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, is a response to the swift passage of a Georgia law that they contend makes it harder for Black people to vote. As the debate about that bill raged in recent weeks, most major corporations — including those with headquarters in Atlanta — did not take a position on the legislation.,“There is no middle ground here,” Mr. Chenault said. “You either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote.”,The executives did not criticize specific companies, but instead called on all of corporate America to publicly and directly oppose new laws that would restrict the rights of Black voters, and to use their clout, money and lobbyists to sway the debate with lawmakers.,“This impacts all Americans, but we also need to acknowledge the history of voting rights for African-Americans,” Mr. Chenault said. “And as African-American executives in corporate America, what we were saying is we want corporate America to understand that, and we want them to work with us.”,The letter was signed by 72 Black executives. They included Roger Ferguson Jr., the chief executive of TIAA; Mellody Hobson and John Rogers Jr., the co-chief executives of Ariel Investments; Robert F. Smith, the chief executive of Vista Equity Partners; and Raymond McGuire, a former Citigroup executive who is running for mayor of New York.,In the days before the Georgia law was passed, , spoke out against the legislation, which introduced stricter voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited drop boxes and expanded the legislature’s power over elections.,Big corporations based in Atlanta, including Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola and Home Depot, offered general statements of support for voting rights, but none took a specific stance on the bills. The same was true for most of the executives who signed the new letter, including Mr. Frazier and Mr. Chenault.,Mr. Frazier said he had paid only peripheral attention to the matter before the Georgia law was passed on Thursday. “When the law passed, I started paying attention,” he said.,When Mr. Frazier realized what was in the new law, and that similar bills were being advanced in other states, he and Mr. Chenault decided to take action. On Sunday, they began emailing and texting with a group of Black executives, discussing what more corporations could do.,“There seems to be no one speaking out,” Mr. Frazier said. “We thought if we spoke up, it might lead to a situation where others felt the responsibility to speak up.”,Among the other executives who signed the letter were Ursula Burns, a former chief executive of Xerox; Richard Parsons, a former chairman of Citigroup and chief executive of Time Warner; and Tony West, the chief legal officer at Uber. The group of leaders, with support from the Black Economic Alliance, bought a full-page ad in the Wednesday print edition of The New York Times.,The executives are hoping that big companies will help prevent dozens of similar bills in other states from becoming law.,“The Georgia legislature was the first one,” Mr. Frazier said. “If corporate America doesn’t stand up, we’ll get these laws passed in many places in this country.”,In 2017, Mr. Frazier was the first chief executive to publicly resign from President Donald J. Trump’s business advisory councils after the president’s equivocating response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. His , led other chief executives to distance themselves from Mr. Trump, and the advisory groups disbanded.,“As African-American business executives, we don’t have the luxury of being bystanders to injustice,” Mr. Frazier said. “We don’t have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines when these kinds of injustices are happening all around us.”,Companies have taken stands on state legislation in recent years, often to powerful effect. In 2016 and 2017, as conservatives advanced so-called bathroom bills in states including Indiana, North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, big companies went so far as to threaten to take their business elsewhere if the laws were enacted. Those bills were never signed into law.,Last year, the Human Rights Campaign began persuading companies to sign on to , that states their “clear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of L.G.B.T.Q. people in society.” Dozens of major companies, including AT&T, Facebook, Nike and Pfizer, signed on.,To Mr. Chenault, the contrast between the business community’s response to that issue and to voting restrictions that disproportionately harm Black voters was telling.,“You had 60 major companies — Amazon, Google, American Airlines — that signed on to the statement that states a very clear opposition to harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of L.G.B.T.Q. people in society,” he said. “So, you know, it is bizarre that we don’t have companies standing up to this.”,“This is not new,” Mr. Chenault added. “When it comes to race, there’s differential treatment. That’s the reality.”,Activists are now calling for boycotts of Delta and Coca-Cola for their tepid engagement before the Georgia law was passed. And there are signs that other companies and sports leagues are becoming more engaged with the issue.,The head of the Major League Baseball Players Association said he , to a discussion about moving the All-Star Game from Atlanta, where it is planned for July. And Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, released a statement on Tuesday affirming his company’s commitment to voting rights.,“Voting is fundamental to the health and future of our democracy,” he said. “We regularly encourage our employees to exercise their fundamental right to vote, and we stand against efforts that may prevent them from being able to do so.”,That language echoed statements made by many big companies before the Georgia law was passed. The executives who signed the letter are likely to seek more.,“People ask, ‘What can I do?’” Mr. Chenault said. “I’ll tell you what you can do. You can publicly oppose any discriminatory legislation and all measures designed to limit Americans’ ability to vote.”"

Companies like ,, , and , have already announced proposals for hybrid work models that will allow employees to continue to work remotely at least a few days a week.,These new arrangements mean companies may need less office space, and some have already cut back on their real estate needs, according to ,. , said this month that it was giving up office space in downtown Minneapolis, and in September, the sporting goods retailer , in Bellevue, Wash.,“We really are at an inflection point,” said Meena Krenek, an interior design director at Perkins+Will, an architecture firm that is revamping offices, including its own, for new modes of working.,Last spring, while lockdowns were in place, landlords and tenants prepared for what they thought would be ,. Desks were dragged six feet apart and Plexiglas ,. One-way arrows were stenciled on corridor floors, chairs were removed from conference rooms, and an elaborate choreography was developed to determine how and when teams would return to avoid overcrowding.,Then many workers simply stayed home. As the pandemic dragged on and people got the hang of Zoom, many discovered it was possible to be productive while parked on living room sofas or in backyard lawn chairs.,Now, as company heads , to the office, not only safety measures but also the new work arrangements are driving discussions about the postpandemic workplace. More than 80 percent of companies are embracing a hybrid model whereby ,, according to a new survey by KayoCloud, a real estate technology platform.,Workplaces are being reimagined for activities benefiting from face-to-face interaction, including collaboration on projects and employee training, as a way to promote a company’s culture and identity.,Common areas will be increased and equipped with furniture that can be moved as needs change. Steelcase and Knoll, suppliers of office furniture, report strong interest in mobile tables, carts and partitions.,But as the amount of space devoted to gathering expands, the fate of one’s own personal turf at the office — a desk decorated with family photos, a couple of file cabinets — hangs in the balance. Why, company leaders are asking, should someone who is in the office one or two days a week require a space that will sit empty the rest of the time?,In some cases, personal desks are being replaced with “hoteling” workstations, also called hot desks, which can be used by whoever needs a place to touch down for a day.,In the early months of the pandemic, when it was believed that the coronavirus was spread via contaminated surfaces, hot desks got a hard no from office users. But that stance has softened with the recognition that the virus is transmitted mainly through the air. Protocols for wiping down tabletops before and after use have become the norm. So has reserving a hot desk ahead of time rather than simply showing up and grabbing a free spot.,Workers have often resisted the loss of their personal desks when companies sought to reduce their real estate footprint, but they may be more amenable to the idea now if the payoff is the ability to skip the commute and work from home.,“A year ago, if I had interviewed people, they would have said they definitely need three file cabinets and a bookshelf,” said Andrea Vanecko, a principal at the architecture firm NBBJ. “Now there’s a very different answer.”,Conference rooms, too, are getting a reboot. In the past, these rooms were predicated on the idea of people gathering in person. A large screen on a wall might be used for presentations or to let an executive in another location make a cameo appearance.,But some employees are permanently moving to remote work, and companies are puzzling over how to give them the same ability to participate as those who are physically present. There are even early discussions about using artificial intelligence to conjure up , of employees who are off site but could still ,.,For now, some companies are having in-person attendees continue to use their laptops so that remote workers can see everyone on their Zoom screens, an effort to “help maintain a sense of equivalency that we’ve come to expect,” said Peter Knutson, chief strategy officer of A+I, a design firm.,Devices combining 360-degree cameras, microphones and speakers are being placed on a table or tripod to improve sound and visibility. In the future, these technologies are likely to be built into gathering places and the number of screens increased, transforming the conference room into a “Zoom room,” Ms. Krenek said.,Likewise, some phone booths — the closet-size pods deployed in open-plan offices to give workers a place to make private calls — may give way to videoconferencing booths, which ,.,Screens are destined to pop up elsewhere. One near the coffee bar or at a cafe table could allow those on the premises to meet virtually for a latte or lunch with colleagues working remotely.,And digital whiteboards are likely to become more popular, so workers at home can see what’s being written in real time.,Modifications made to offices to protect against the coronavirus are still in effect. Stopgap measures may fade away as the pandemic loosens its grip, but others will be here to stay.,In lobbies, floor decals spaced six feet apart may be around “just until people get into the habit,” said Natalie Engels, a principal at Gensler, an architecture firm. Signs that had proliferated during the pandemic — promoting “self-cleaning” elevator buttons and virus-zapping technologies like ionization and ultraviolet light — will eventually be removed.,But increasingly, moving through an office building is likely to be a hands-free experience aided by mobile apps, sensors and voice controls, even after the reluctance to touch surfaces diminishes.,Sensors will allow employees to enter a turnstile and summon an elevator with the wave of a hand. Landlords who have yet to invest in such systems have experimented with ,. Buttons on walls outside restrooms can be pressed with an elbow, averting the need to touch door handles. Some companies are adding ,.,The coronavirus has focused attention on air quality in what may be a lasting way. , before the pandemic and have become more so as fresh air has gone from being a nicety to being a necessity.,Landlords have in some cases adjusted HVAC systems to increase the amount of outdoor air being pumped in. They are also upgrading filters to trap smaller airborne particles.,Some measures are being enshrined in leases, said Geoffrey F. Fay, a real estate lawyer with Pullman & Comley. But landlords are doing such things proactively, he added, as they try to make offices as enticing as possible at a time when tenants may be wondering if they even need to rent space anymore.,“Landlords realize we are on the precipice of change,” he said. “They want to make employees feel comfortable to the extent they’re coming back to the office.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/grocery-retail-mask-mandates.html,"As Mask Mandates Lift, Retail Workers Again Feel Vulnerable","Marilyn Reece, the lead bakery clerk at a Kroger in Batesville, Miss., started noticing more customers walking around the store without masks this month after the state mandate to wear face coverings was repealed. Kroger still requires them, but that doesn’t seem to matter.,When Ms. Reece, a 56-year-old breast-cancer survivor, sees those shoppers, she prays. “Please, please, don’t let me have to wait on them, because in my heart, I don’t want to ignore them, I don’t want to refuse them,” she said. “But then I’m thinking I don’t want to get sick and die, either. It’s not that people are bad, but you don’t know who they’ve come into contact with.”,Ms. Reece’s heightened anxiety is shared by retail and fast-food workers in states like Mississippi and Texas, where governments have removed , before a majority of people have been vaccinated and while troubling new variants of the coronavirus are appearing. It feels like a return to the early days of the pandemic, when businesses said customers must wear masks but there was no legal requirement and numerous shoppers simply refused. Many workers say that their stores do not enforce the requirement, and that if they do approach customers, they risk verbal or physical altercations.,“It’s given a great false sense of security, and it’s no different now than it was a year ago,” said Ms. Reece, who is not yet able to receive a vaccine because of allergies. “The only difference we have now is people are getting vaccinated but enough people haven’t gotten vaccinated that they should have lifted the mandate.”,For many people who work in retail, especially grocery stores and big-box chains, the mask repeals are another example of how little protection and appreciation they have received during the pandemic. While they were praised as essential workers, that rarely , on top of their low wages. Grocery employees were not initially given priority for vaccinations in ,, even as health experts cautioned the public to limit time in grocery stores because of the risk posed by new coronavirus variants. (Texas opened availability to everyone 16 and older on Monday.),The issue has gained serious prominence: On Monday, President Biden called on governors and mayors to , as the nation grapples with a potential rise in virus cases.,The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents nearly 900,000 grocery workers, said this month that at least 34,700 grocery workers around the country had been infected with or exposed to Covid-19 and that at least 155 workers had died from the virus. The recent mass shooting at a ,, has only rattled workers further and added to concerns about their own safety.,Diane Cambre, a 50-year-old floor supervisor at a Kroger in Midlothian, Texas, said she had spent much of the past year worrying about bringing the virus home to her 9-year-old son and dreading interactions with customers who were flippant about the possibility of getting sick. She wears a double mask in the store even though it irritates her skin, already itchy from psoriasis, and changes her clothes as soon as she gets home.,After Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on March 2 that he would , the next week, Ms. Cambre said, customers immediately “started coming in not wearing a mask and stuff, and it’s been pretty hard getting anybody to wear one.” Management is supposed to offer masks to people who aren’t wearing them, but if they don’t put them on, nothing else is done, she said.,Asking customers to wear masks can result in tense exchanges and even ,.,“Some of our customers are drama-prone, so they’ll start yelling, ‘I’m not wearing that mask,’ and you can tell they’re very rude in their voice and very harsh,” Ms. Cambre, a U.F.C.W. member, said. Overseeing the self-checkout aisles has been especially challenging, she said, because customers who need help will demand that she come over, making it impossible to maintain six feet of distance.,At times when she has tried to explain the need for distancing, “they say, ‘OK, and that’s just a government thing,’” she said. “It really takes a toll on you mentally.”,A Kroger representative said that the chain would “continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our frontline grocery associates can receive the Covid-19 vaccine,” and that it was offering $100 one-time payments to workers who received the vaccine.,The differing state and business mandates have some workers worried about more ,. The retail industry was already trying to address the issue last fall, when a major trade group helped put together training to help workers manage and de-escalate conflicts with customers who resisted masks, social distancing and store capacity limits. ,, or asking them to leave, has led to incidents in the past year like a cashier’s being punched in the face, a Target employee’s breaking his arm and the fatal shooting of a ,.,This month in League City, Texas, near Houston, a 53-year-old man who , a required mask in a , confronted employees and then stabbed a store manager three times, according to a report in The Houston Chronicle. On March 14, a San Antonio ramen shop , with racist graffiti after its owner criticized Mr. Abbott on television for lifting the Texas mask mandate.,On March 17, a 65-year-old woman was arrested in an , after she refused to wear a mask or leave the store, just days after an arrest warrant was issued for her in Galveston, Texas, for behaving similarly in a , location.,MaryAnn Kaylor, the owner of two antique stores in Dallas, including Lula B’s Design District, said the mask mandate repeal mattered a lot for stores and people’s behavior. ,“He should have focused more on getting people vaccinated instead of trying to open everything up,” she said of Governor Abbott, noting that Texas has one of the country’s slowest vaccination rates. ,“You still have cases every day in Texas, and you have people dying still from Covid,” she said. “This complete lifting of mandates is stupid. It shouldn’t have been based on politics — it should have been based on science.”,Some Texans have started to seek out mask-friendly establishments. Ms. Kaylor said that lists of Dallas businesses that require masks had been circulating on Facebook, and that people were consulting them to figure out where to buy groceries and do other shopping.,Emily Francois, a sales associate at a Walmart in Port Arthur, Texas, said that customers had been ignoring signs to wear masks and that Walmart had not been enforcing the policy. So Ms. Francois stands six feet away from shoppers who don’t wear masks, even though that upsets some of them. “My life is more important,” she said.,“I see customers coming in without a mask and they’re coughing, sneezing, they’re not covering their mouths,” said Ms. Francois, who has worked at Walmart for 14 years and is a member of United for Respect, an advocacy group. “Customers coming in the store without masks make us feel like we aren’t worthy, we aren’t safe.”,Phillip Keene, a spokesman for Walmart, said that “our policy of requiring associates and customers to wear masks in our stores has helped protect them during the pandemic, and we’re not lifting those measures at this time.”,Even before the pandemic, Ms. Reece, the Kroger clerk in Mississippi, was wearing a mask to protect herself from the flu because of her cancer diagnosis, she said.,She said 99 percent of customers in her small store had worn masks during the pandemic. “When they had to put it on, they did put it on,” she said. “It’s like giving a child a piece of candy — that child is going to eat that candy unless you take it from them.”,She is concerned about the potential harm from new variants, particularly from those who don’t cover their mouths. “You just have to pray and pray you don’t get within six feet of them, or 10 feet for that matter,” said Ms. Reece, who is also a U.F.C.W. member and has worked for Kroger for more than 30 years. “I know people want it to be back to normal, but you can’t just will it to be back to normal.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html,"Maggots, Rape and Yet Five Stars: How U.S. Ratings of Nursing Homes Mislead the Public","Twelve years ago, the U.S. government introduced a powerful new tool to help people make a wrenching decision: which nursing home to choose for loved ones at their most vulnerable. Using a simple star rating — one being the worst, five the best — the system promised to distill reams of information and transform an emotional process into one based on objective, government-blessed metrics.,The star system quickly became ubiquitous, a popular way for consumers to educate themselves and for nursing homes to attract new customers. During the coronavirus pandemic, with many locked-down homes unavailable for prospective residents or their families to see firsthand, the ratings seemed indispensable.,But a New York Times investigation, based on the most comprehensive analysis of the data that powers the ratings program, found that it is broken.,Despite ,, the system provided a badly distorted picture of the quality of care at the nation’s nursing homes. Many relied on sleight-of-hand maneuvers to improve their ratings and hide shortcomings that contributed to the damage when the pandemic struck.,More than , nursing-home residents have died of Covid-19, and The Times’s analysis found that people at five-star facilities were roughly as likely to die of the disease as those at one-star homes.,The ratings program, run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, relies on a mix of self-reported data from more than 15,000 nursing homes and on-site examinations by state health inspectors. Nursing homes receive scores based on how they fare in those inspections; how much time nurses spend with residents; and the quality of care that residents receive. Those three grades are then combined into an overarching star rating for each nursing home.,To evaluate the ratings’ reliability, The Times built a database to analyze millions of payroll records to determine how much hands-on care nursing homes provide residents, combed through 373,000 reports by state inspectors and examined financial statements submitted to the government by more than 10,000 nursing homes.,The Times obtained access to portions of the ratings data that aren’t publicly available from academics who had research agreements with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S.,Among The Times’s findings:,At homes whose five stars masked serious problems, residents developed bed sores so severe that their bones were exposed. Others lost the ability to move.,But the most important impact may be that the nursing home industry was ill equipped for the pandemic. The rating system allowed facilities to score high grades without upgrading the care they provided.,“They were working to improve their ratings, but not their quality,” said Charlene Harrington, who sits on a board that advises C.M.S. on the ratings system.,“The problems with the five-star system left these homes less prepared in the pandemic,” she said. “They were allowed to not have enough staffing, and they were allowed to ignore infection-control deficiencies, so they had poorer quality than the public knew about, and they were in the worst position to manage Covid.”,Fulton Commons Care, a nursing home on Long Island, is among hundreds of facilities whose five stars reflected self-reported data that was at times inaccurate.,One of the home’s residents was Stasia Kochanowska, a 75-year-old retired nurse. Last March, her son, John Costa, got a phone call from Fulton Commons: She was being moved from a private room into one with other residents. Mr. Costa interpreted that as evidence that the home was short-staffed or overcrowded. “I thought that the idea was to isolate people to keep them safe from the virus,” he said.,Not long after, he got another call: Ms. Kochanowska had a fever. On the morning of April 10, Mr. Costa got the news he had been dreading: His mother had died from Covid-19.,“Looking back now, I realize that the star doesn’t work and shouldn’t be trusted,” Mr. Costa said. “But it’s too late.”,The star system was introduced in 2008. , were buying many nursing homes, and lawmakers worried that the quality of care would deteriorate. (Today, for-profit companies own about 70 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.),The only way to evaluate nursing homes at the time was , called Nursing Home Compare. It included tables of statistics about each nursing home. Consumers largely ignored the information.,The new system transformed hard-to-digest information on resident safety, staffing and dozens of other metrics into simple star ratings.,The rating starts with the grade from the in-person inspections and then awards bonus points for facilities that score well on the other two ratings: for staffing and their quality of care. The staffing score reflects the number of hours that employees spend with patients. The quality-of-care rating incorporates 15 metrics — such as residents’ wounds and medications — drawn from what are essentially medical report cards for every resident.,C.M.S. posts each nursing home’s overall star rating, and its ratings for inspections, staffing and quality of care, on a website called ,When the system was first rolled out, elder-care groups applauded it for providing an easy-to-understand look inside nursing homes. As it gained popularity, it became a powerful determinant of fortunes in an industry with thin profit margins.,Five-star facilities earned about $2,000 in profits per bed in 2019, according to a Times analysis of nursing homes’ financial statements. Those with three or four stars earned about $1,000 per bed. Poorly rated homes were typically not profitable.,But within months of the star system’s launch, members of a Medicare advisory board cautioned federal officials that nursing homes were incentivized to fudge their numbers, according to board members and former regulators. Board members, including Ms. Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of University of California, San Francisco, called for more auditing of the self-reported data.,Audits, however, remain rare, according to 25 former government officials, congressional aides, nursing home executives and elder-care advocates who meet regularly with C.M.S. officials.,The Times found that from 2017 to 2019 health inspectors wrote up about 5,700 nursing homes, more than one out of every three in the country, for misreporting data about residents’ well-being. That included nearly 800 homes with top ratings. Some facilities didn’t tell the government about certain medications they were giving residents. Others didn’t disclose when residents took serious falls or developed bed sores.,Even when inspectors discovered such misreporting, they didn’t conduct more detailed audits of all of the data that the homes submitted to C.M.S.,A spokeswoman for C.M.S. said in a statement that the star-rating system is “intended to serve as one tool” for people to choose nursing homes. “Overall scores should be considered in light of a potential resident’s unique care needs,” she said. (C.M.S. would not identify the spokeswoman.),C.M.S. in recent years “has made multiple substantial improvements to both the ratings methodology and data reliability of the five-star quality rating system. These improvements have made it more difficult to attain or maintain higher ratings, driving providers to continue improving the quality of care they provide,” the spokeswoman said.,She said the Department of Health and Human Services “takes reports of fraud seriously” and that “C.M.S. deploys enforcement and accountability measures swiftly if fraud is detected.”,The warnings about self-reported data have been borne out by researchers.,A , last year by Integra Med Analytics, a data firm started by a University of Texas professor, compared hospital admissions data with the information nursing homes submitted to Medicare. The paper concluded that half of nursing homes underreported potentially deadly pressure ulcers, or bed sores, by at least 50 percent.,In 2019, the , found that nursing homes reported only 16 percent of incidents where residents were hospitalized for “potential abuse and neglect.”,And researchers at the University of Chicago ,, from 2011 to 2015, nursing homes didn’t tell Medicare about 40 percent of residents who were hospitalized after serious falls.,One of the worst offenders in that study was the Clove Lakes home on Staten Island in New York, where 72 residents were admitted to a hospital after falling, but only 15 were reported to C.M.S. A Clove Lakes spokeswoman declined to comment.,Menorah Park, a facility in Beachwood, Ohio, that had five stars, disclosed only 11 of 47 serious falls.,Kathleen DeVito, a former resident at Menorah Park, said in an interview that she selected the facility based on its perfect rating. One night, she said, aides took her to the bathroom and then left her alone. She crashed to the floor while trying to wipe herself. Her ankle was shattered, her medical records show. She now has to use a walker.,“I think about how much better I’d be if I had never gone there,” said Ms. DeVito, 78, a retired paralegal.,Beth Silver, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, said, “The incidence of falls at Menorah Park is in line with other highly regarded facilities at both the state and federal levels, and are even lower for serious falls, which we attribute to our rigorous fall prevention program.”,She added, “While our sympathy goes out to anyone who may have been injured while a resident at our facility, it does not necessarily mean that the facility was at fault or could have prevented the injury.”,In 2018, C.M.S. improved the way it collected staffing data. Instead of asking nursing homes to report the average number of hours nurses and aides spent with residents, the agency required homes to submit payroll records that logged their daily hours. The hope was that such data would be harder to manipulate.,With the payroll records, nursing homes’ average staffing numbers plummeted, according to the Times analysis. That suggested that homes had previously been inflating their nursing data.,Even with the new system, many homes still appear to exaggerate how much time nurses spend with patients.,The Times analyzed the publicly available staffing logs submitted to C.M.S. Thousands of homes — including more than 450 with four or five stars for staffing — derived at least half of their nursing hours from administrators who don’t care for patients. C.M.S. permits the practice, but the public sees only the total number of hours, not the breakdown between administrative nurses and registered nurses who care for patients.,Sun Terrace Healthcare Center had a two-star rating for staffing in early 2019. Then, in the second half of the year, the home, in Sun City Center, Fla., reported a surge in its nursing hours. The bulk of that increase was from the addition of administrators to the tally. By January 2020, Sun Terrace had a five-star rating.,“The administrative nursing staff at Sun Terrace work very closely with the direct care staff in a collaborative team approach to ensure the facility provides the best possible care for each and every resident,” said Alexander J. Kusmierz, the facility’s executive director.,In light of questions from The Times, Mr. Kusmierz said, the home would audit the staffing data it has reported to C.M.S. “Sun Terrace will continue to make certain that the information provided is thorough and accurate,” he said.,Researchers have , that the better staffed a facility was, the fewer residents they lost to Covid-19. More employees meant that patients received better care and were more closely monitored. When the pandemic hit, staffing came under additional strain as nurses and workers fell ill.,Trinity Homes, a facility with 230 beds in Minot, N.D., received five stars for its staffing levels. But residents repeatedly complained to inspectors that the place was short-staffed. In 2019, half of Trinity’s nursing hours came from administrators.,More than 130 residents contracted Covid-19. Thirty-five died.,Karim Tripodina, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the home complies with C.M.S. requirements and has “ample staff to care for our residents.” She said that Covid-19 spread inside the facility at the same time it was spreading in the local community, “despite aggressive efforts to maintain a safe environment.”,Carrie Johnson, 75, had just had spinal fusion surgery. A raw incision snaked up her back, and it needed to be cleaned regularly to prevent infection. She couldn’t control her bowels.,Using the C.M.S. website, Ms. Johnson found a nursing home, Brookdale Richmond Place, where she could recuperate. Part of the country’s largest chain of senior living communities, it was a short drive from her house in Lexington, Ky., and the only local facility with a five-star rating for staffing.,“We thought it meant that I’d be safe,” Ms. Johnson said.,That was not what it meant.,At the time, in October 2017, Brookdale was operating with a skeleton crew, according to six current and former employees and court documents filed in a lawsuit brought by Ms. Johnson. Overwhelmed employees at the 120-bed facility would wake some residents as early as 3:30 a.m. to get them dressed for breakfast and then would put the residents back into bed to wait the hours until mealtime, the lawsuit alleged.,More than a week passed before Ms. Johnson was first given a shower, her medical records show. Her surgical wound was not treated. No one came when she rang her call bell for help going to the toilet, so she sat for hours in her own urine and feces. At one point, Ms. Johnson said, a passing maintenance man changed her diaper.,On at least three days in her first month there, no one brought her pain medication. Some days there were no nurses on the floor tending to patients, according to the current and former employees and depositions in the pending lawsuit. Nurses spent an average of less than 30 minutes a day per patient.,Brookdale, however, told Medicare that each resident received an average of 75 minutes of daily care. The home arrived at that number by including nurses who were stationed at Brookdale’s corporate headquarters in Tennessee, some 200 miles away, according to depositions and the employees.,Absent the inflated staffing numbers, Brookdale’s rating would most likely have fallen to one or two stars.,Jessica Crutchfield, a nursing assistant who worked at the Brookdale home while Ms. Johnson was there, said in a deposition last year that her supervisors told her to falsify residents’ medical records to make it look like they received more care than they did. When she refused, she was fired, she said.,Heather Hunter, a spokeswoman for Brookdale, said, “We have detailed policies in place to ensure compliance with C.M.S. reporting rules, and we are not aware of any instance where inaccurate or false information was submitted by any of our communities outside of the confines of the C.M.S. rules.”,Ms. Johnson’s incision began to fester. In November 2017, a physical therapist noticed that it “appeared open and presented with discoloration around incisions.” She alerted the nursing staff, records show, but it took six days before anyone treated the wound.,When Ms. Johnson went to an outside doctor, her wound was infected, medical records show. The doctor sent her to the hospital. The infection left her unable to move. Her muscles atrophied.,Ms. Hunter didn’t comment on what happened to Ms. Johnson. “While The New York Times has the right to print unproven allegations from one side of a lawsuit seeking monetary damages, we choose not to litigate unsubstantiated facts in the press,” she said.,Ms. Johnson now lives at home. She used to manage the kitchen at a local homeless shelter; now she can’t walk or even stand. She said she spends about six hours a day in front of the television, waiting for her husband to get back from work. She misses cooking sloppy joes for her six grandchildren.,“I wouldn’t send my dog there,” Ms. Johnson said of Brookdale. “That five-star rating is garbage.”,Medicare began tracking nursing homes’ use of certain prescription drugs after the Health and Human Services inspector general , that facilities were overusing antipsychotic drugs, which can be especially dangerous for older people. The ratings system now penalizes homes that overmedicate residents.,According to court documents and interviews with nurses, administrators and government officials, nursing homes for years have underreported the number of residents on opiates and antipsychotics.,On Dec. 12, 2017, Eunice Hill checked into National Healthcare Corporation’s nursing home in Greenville, S.C., for what was supposed to be a short-term rehab stay after a nasty fall made it hard for her to walk. (National Healthcare, a publicly traded company, operates 75 facilities around the United States.) Ms. Hill’s daughter, Anne Brown, said she and her mother drew comfort from the facility’s five-star rating.,That first day at the nursing home, staff gave Ms. Hill Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic, her medical records show. She was also given anti-anxiety medications every day for a week.,That is not what National Healthcare told the government. At least four times a year, nursing homes are required to provide C.M.S. “minimum data sets” for each patient, the equivalent of medical report cards that detail things like weight, medications and wounds. In Ms. Hill’s data set, National Healthcare said that she did not receive any antipsychotics and only got anti-anxiety drugs once.,A National Healthcare spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a pending lawsuit that Ms. Hill’s daughter filed against the company.,Ms. Hill, 93 and suffering from diabetes, started skipping meals, causing her blood sugar levels to go wild, according to her medical records. In late December, she was rushed to a hospital. Doctors found her kidneys were failing and that she was severely dehydrated.,She died on Jan. 3, less than a month after she arrived at the National Healthcare home.,At the Good Samaritan home in Albert Lea, Minn., a resident’s foot became infested with , in 2018 after her bandages were left on for days. At Dwelling Place in Dover, N.J., staff didn’t change residents’ , for more than a month last year, increasing the risk of infection.,In both cases, government health inspectors determined that the nursing homes failed to keep their residents safe. Yet both earned five stars.,The C.M.S. rating system puts the greatest weight on in-person inspections; they are the starting point for the final star rating.,But the exams do little to penalize homes with serious problems. At nearly 1,200 homes with five stars, inspectors over a three-year period identified at least one problem involving potential patient abuse, such as violence committed by staff or the failure to investigate injuries, The Times found.,In 2019, health inspectors , a nursing assistant at the Reo Vista home in San Diego had followed a resident who uses a wheelchair to her room from the kitchen, where she was getting a late-night sandwich. The employee pushed her on the bed and raped her, according to the inspection report.,The report classified the attack as a “category F” violation, a low-level problem that caused potential, not actual, harm.,That designation helped Reo Vista hold onto its perfect rating, which it trumpets on its website.,“This former staff member’s actions do not reflect the values we hold at our facility that our overall five-star rating more accurately reflects,” said William Fredricksen, Reo Vista’s administrator. He said the home was using background checks and other means “to ensure that something like this never again occurs at our facility.”,At 40 other five-star nursing homes, inspectors similarly determined that sexual abuse did not constitute actual harm or put residents in “immediate jeopardy,” The Times found.,After a complaint in 2019, for example, inspectors , that a nursing assistant at Hickory Creek in Madison, Ind., had barged into the bathroom while a resident was showering and groped her breasts. Hickory Creek kept its five stars.,Hickory Creek officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,At Manor Care in Boca Raton, Fla., John Schulz, a 57-year-old resident with Alzheimer’s, was strangled to death by another resident in 2019. The state coroner ruled it a homicide. The death doesn’t appear in inspection records at all. The facility has a five-star rating.,“The unfortunate incident was very isolated,” said Julie Beckert, a spokeswoman. She said staff responded “quickly and appropriately” to the strangulation.,In theory, health inspections can occur at any time, without notice.,But The Times found that in 2019 about 70 percent of nursing homes increased their staff on the days that inspectors visited, compared with their typical staffing levels on that day of the week.,On average, the homes added 25 hours of staff time — a roughly 8 percent increase — to their rosters on the day of the inspection. For more than 800 facilities, inspection day was the best-staffed day of the year.,The odds of that happening randomly are virtually zero, suggesting that many homes are able to anticipate their inspection dates.,When inspectors visited Mitchell-Hollingsworth Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Florence, Ala., on a Thursday in,September 2019, the home recorded its highest level of staffing all year: 785 total hours worked by nurses and aides, 15 percent higher than other Thursdays that year.,“We have absolutely no indication of when the inspectors are coming,” said Brian Scheri, the home’s administrator.,In some cases, corruption was to blame. In 2017, a state health inspector in Florida , to accepting $500,000 in bribes for telling homes about future inspections. Fifteen years earlier, the head of Oklahoma’s health department pleaded guilty to similar charges.,Nursing home staff and state-funded watchdogs said in interviews that hundreds of homes seemed to know in advance about the timing of inspections.,“Every home seemed to get a tip and would roll out the red carpet,” said Tony Cisney, a former inspector responsible for visiting about a dozen homes in Kentucky.,The coronavirus hit America’s nursing homes harder than any other part of the country. Nearly one out of every 10 nursing home residents died from Covid-19.,The pandemic laid bare the flaws in the government rating system.,The state health inspections do little to penalize homes with poor records of preventing and controlling infections. From 2017 to 2019, The Times found, inspectors cited nearly 60 percent — more than 2,000 — of the country’s five-star facilities at least once for not following basic safety precautions, like regular hand washing. Yet they earned top ratings.,In San Bernardino, Calif., inspectors wrote up Del Rosa Villa for four different infection-control violations. It kept its five stars. Ninety residents at the 104-bed facility have contracted the coronavirus, and 13 have died.,Del Rosa Villa officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,Life Care Centers of Kirkland, Wash., the first nursing home in the United States to have documented coronavirus cases, was found in 2019 to have weak infection controls, despite its five stars. State inspectors wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.”,Thirty-nine of the facility’s , have died from Covid-19. The home has 190 beds.,Leigh Atherton, a Life Care spokeswoman, said that citation was the only lapse in infection control that inspectors had identified over 32 previous visits. She said the home quickly fixed the problem.,If the rating system worked as intended, it would have offered clues as to which homes were most likely to have out-of-control outbreaks and which homes would probably muddle through.,That is not what happened.,The Times found that there was little if any correlation between star ratings and how homes fared during the pandemic. At five-star facilities, the death rate from Covid-19 was only half a percentage point lower than at facilities that received lower ratings. And the death rate was slightly lower at two-star facilities than at four-star homes.,A facility’s location, the infection rate of the surrounding community and the race of nursing home residents , of whether a nursing home would suffer an outbreak. The star ratings didn’t matter.,That is consistent with academic research. , found little relationship between a facility’s star rating and its Covid-19 infection and death rates.,At Fulton Commons Care in East Meadow, N.Y., its five stars largely stemmed from its self-reported data, which researchers have found at times to be incorrect.,The home reported only 11 instances of residents taking serious falls between 2011 and 2015. The University of Chicago researchers, however, identified 40 falls for which residents were hospitalized. Similarly, Integra Med Analytics found that, at most, Fulton Commons was reporting to C.M.S. one-third of its residents’ pressure ulcers. The research firm , the home deserved one star, not five.,Fulton Commons officials did not respond to requests for comment.,Fulton Commons stopped allowing visitors last March. Automated phone calls assured family members that the virus hadn’t infiltrated the home.,Stasia Kochanowska died from Covid-19 on April 10. That same day, another resident, 88-year-old Adele Guyear, spoke to her daughter, Pamela Martin. Usually bubbly, Ms. Guyear now sounded terrified. She said her roommate had died from the virus. So had two women down the hall. And, Ms. Guyear told her daughter, she had a bad cough.,Ms. Martin initially had been comforted by the home’s five-star rating. But during the pandemic she had struggled to get her phone calls returned. Now, hearing from her mother, Ms. Martin began to panic.,She said she called the home and demanded that Ms. Guyear be sent to a hospital. There, she tested positive for Covid-19. Her mother survived, but she can’t breathe without supplemental oxygen, Ms. Martin said.,On May 15, health inspectors cited Fulton Commons for having a deficient program for preventing and controlling infections. C.M.S. , the problem as causing “minimal harm or the potential for actual harm.” The facility kept its five stars.,Forty-one Fulton Commons residents have died from Covid-19.,“Knowing what I know now,” Ms. Martin said, “you’d have to be crazy to give this place a five-star rating.”,The Times’s analysis of the star system’s effectiveness was based in large part on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S. The Times used data from ,, before the pandemic upended the industry and temporarily changed data-collection practices. The primary analysis examined the characteristics of homes with five-star ratings, including their staffing patterns and code violations.,The core data set was from the Nursing Home Compare system. That included the most recent set of star ratings for each facility and the underlying metrics. To see how these ratings changed over time, The Times also examined , and metrics going back to 2015.,The Times looked at all code violations reported in the three inspection cycles included in the January 2020 data.,The analysis also incorporated nursing homes’ 2019 , (daily logs of the hours worked by nurses, aides and administrators) and , (financial statements that facilities submit to the government). The cost reports were used to examine the relationship between profitability and the star system.,In addition, The Times used summary data provided by researchers who were granted access to individualized data on Medicare claims. By examining how often nursing home residents were admitted to hospitals , or complications from ,, the researchers demonstrated the extent to which facilities underreported serious health incidents in data they submit for ratings purposes.,Susan Beachy contributed research."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/biden-electric-vehicles-infrastructure.html,"Biden’s Push for Electric Cars: $174 Billion, 10 Years and a Bit of Luck","President Biden is a muscle-car guy — one of his , that he got from his father. But he’s trying to make this an electric vehicle world.,The , that he , is aimed at tackling climate change in part by spending up to $174 billion to encourage Americans to switch to cars and trucks that run on electricity, not gasoline or diesel. That is a large investment but it might not be enough to push most Americans toward E.V.s.,Despite rapid growth in recent years, electric vehicles remain a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks on the road. They have been slow to take off in large part because they can cost up to $10,000 more than similar conventional cars and trucks. Charging E.V.s is also more difficult and slower than simply refilling the tank at far more prevalent gas stations.,Mr. Biden hopes to address many of those challenges through federal largess. He aims to lower the cost of electric vehicles by offering individuals, businesses and governments tax credits, rebates and other incentives. To address the chicken-and-egg problem of getting people to try a new technology before it is widely accepted, he hopes to build half a million chargers by 2030 so people will feel confident that they won’t be stranded when they run out of juice. And he is offering help to automakers to get them to build electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.,“We find ourselves at a unique moment here where most American businesses and many states are looking toward a decarbonized future, but recognize there’s a big lift on the infrastructure side,” said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental research group. “This investment alone obviously won’t solve the climate problem or fix all of the infrastructure in the United States but it will be a huge boost.”,Automakers see the writing on the wall and many, including ,. But even they acknowledge that they will need federal help.,“This transformation is greater than any one policy, branch or level of government, or industry sector,” a group representing ,. “It will require a sustained holistic approach with a broad range of legislative and regulatory policies rooted in economic, social, environmental and cultural realities.”,The letter called for grants, loans, tax credits and tax deductions to promote research and manufacturing. The authors of the letter, which included industry groups and the United Auto Workers union, called for investment in job training programs and federal help in promoting development of minerals and other raw materials in the United States.,But production is only one piece of the puzzle. The transition away from gas-powered vehicles rests on convincing consumers of the benefits of electric vehicles. That hasn’t been easy because the cars have higher sticker prices even though researchers say that they cost less to own. Electricity is cheaper on a per mile basis than gasoline, and E.V.s require less routine maintenance — there is no oil to change — than combustion-engine cars.,The single biggest cost of an electric car comes from the battery, which can run about $15,000 for a midsize sedan. That cost has been dropping and is widely expected to keep falling thanks to manufacturing improvements and technical advancements. But some scholars believe that a major technological breakthrough will be required to make electric cars much, much cheaper.,“There’s a good sense that at least for the next maybe five years or so they’re going to keep declining, but then are they going to level off or are they going to keep declining?” Joshua Linn, a professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, an environmental nonprofit, said about battery costs. “That won’t be enough, so then that’s given rise to a lot of attention to infrastructure.”,The federal government and some states already offer tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of electric cars. But the main such federal incentive — a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of new electric cars — begins to phase out for cars once an automaker has sold 200,000 E.V.s. Buyers of Tesla and G.M. electric cars, for example, no longer qualify for that tax credit but buyers of Ford and Volkswagen electric cars do.,Mr. Biden described his incentives for electric car purchases as rebates available at the “point of sale,” presumably meaning at dealerships or while ordering cars online. But the administration has not released details about how big those rebates will be and which vehicles they would apply to.,Another big concern is charging. People with dedicated parking spots typically charge their E.V.s overnight at home, but many people who live in apartments or have to drive longer distances need to use public charging stations, which are still greatly outnumbered by gas stations.,“The top three reasons consumers give for not buying E.V.s are lack of charging stations, time to charge, and the cost of E.V.s,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “They seem to be really emphasizing all three. So, over all, it looks very promising.”,There are ,, most with multiple pumps. Mr. Biden’s plan calls for a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers within the decade, up from , with more than 100,000 outlets today, according to the Energy Department.,“One of the things that needs to be addressed is getting chargers into places where people only have on-street parking, like in cities and urban areas where you don’t have a driveway or garage,” Mr. Abuelsamid said. “If they can address that, it will make E.V.s available to a lot more people.”,The government in China, which leads the world in the use of electric cars, has done much more than the United States to speed up the installation of chargers.,“It is, famously, one of the ways that China has become the No. 1 country in E.V.s on most dimensions,” John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email.,Even with incentives for manufacturers, a robust charging network and a willing public, the transition to electric cars may take a few decades. Carmakers have improved vehicle reliability in recent years, so many cars stay on the road a long time. The average age of cars and light trucks in the United States ,, up from 9.6 years in 2002, according to IHS Markit, an economic forecasting firm.,Neal E. Boudette, contributed reporting."

Louisville had a clear shot at Stanford, but the top-seeded Cardinal came back — and then some — in the second half.,Both Stanford and South Carolina, No. 1 seeds in an N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament field that has commanded a fair share of difficulty for teams at the top, moved on to the Final Four on Tuesday night to join another No. 1 seed, UConn, and third-seeded Arizona.,Stanford claimed the last spot in the national semifinals with a 78-63 defeat of Louisville, after trailing by 12 points at halftime. South Carolina sailed in the round of 8 with a 62-34 win over Texas.,In the ultimate sign of futility after a run that included upsets of U.C.L.A. and Maryland, Texas scored 0 points in the fourth quarter — missing all 15 of its shots. The Longhorns shot 23 percent for the game.,The Gamecocks dominated from the start to earn their third trip to the national semifinals and their first since winning a national title in 2017.,“When we got knocked down four times this season, they got back up stronger,” South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley said in a television interview after the game, referring to the Gamecocks’ four losses this year. “And that’s the mark of a true champion.”,Louisville’s Dana Evans put up 10 of her 24 points in the first quarter while the Cardinals kept Stanford below 28 percent shooting in the first half.,But a 13-0 run toward the end of the third quarter put the Cardinal ahead as they started containing Louisville’s top scorers. Then, Stanford ran away over the last 10 minutes. Lexie Hull had 21 points and 9 rebounds while Haley Jones had 10 points and 10 rebounds.,Stanford’s Ashten Prechtel, who finished with 16 points and made all six of her shots, opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer that bolstered Stanford’s confidence and sparked a decisive run.,“It was tough to not play in the first half — and I was nervous,” Prechtel said about Louisville’s lead. At halftime, Prechtel said Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer “ripped into us a little bit” and told them they had to “compete in the second half” if they wanted to stay in San Antonio.,“Coming out of halftime, there was urgency to how we were going to play,” Prechtel said.,According to the N.C.A.A., two Black women will be head coaches in the Final Four for the first time: Staley for South Carolina and Adia Barnes of No. 3 Arizona, which will face UConn in the national semifinal.,“There are so many Black coaches out there that don’t get the opportunity, because when A.D.’s don’t see it, they don’t see it,” Staley told reporters after the game, referring to athletic directors. “They’re going to see it in the Final Four on Friday night.”,“Representation matters, and its nothing against anyone else who lost to us,” she added. “I hope that the decision-makers — because there are a lot of jobs out there — that you give Black women the opportunity.”,Staley’s team weaved through Texas’ notorious defense with ease, with Zia Cooke and Destanni Henderson repeatedly feeding Victaria Saxton in the paint. Cooke led with 16 points, and added 6 rebounds and 3 assists. Henderson had 12 points and 7 assists, while Saxton had 12 points and 8 rebounds.,The Longhorns got into gear briefly in the third quarter as more and more Texas fans trickled into the audience after work hours, bolstering the cheers and outcries that bounced around the cavernous stadium walls at the Alamodome.,Audrey Warren, who led Texas with 13 points, scored two of her — and the team’s — three 3-pointers in the third quarter. And at one point, Texas came within 10 points of South Carolina on a second-chance layup by Lauren Ebo.,But that was as close as the Longhorns got after South Carolina took an early 15-point lead and scored 14 points off Texas turnovers. Looking exhausted and downtrodden after Warren scored their final points in the third quarter, the Longhorns let South Carolina celebrate early with a big run while they continued to watch their shots bounce off the rim, not adding a single point to their score in the final 10-minute period.,“It was hard for me to not get too excited,” South Carolina’s Cooke said of the last quarter in a call with reporters after the game.,It was the first scoreless period of the women’s tournament since the N.C.A.A. switched from halves to quarters in 2016, according to the ,. (, had previously set a record for the lowest-scoring quarter in a tournament game with a 1-point period against Oregon in the first round.),“I thought it was a pretty good defensive performance, but I also think that Texas was a little tired,” Staley said.,The Longhorns and Gamecocks had ,, however Texas Coach Vic Schaefer and Staley have — including for the national title in Dallas in 2017, when Schaefer was coaching Mississippi State. The Bulldogs ,, but , for its only championship. Staley beat Schaefer in 12 out of their 15 meetings while they were Southeastern Conference foes.,“I always look forward to playing Vic because of what he puts into his scouting reports, his game-planning and his scheming,” Staley told reporters on Monday.,Even without the pandemic, Texas went through significant transition this summer when Schaefer took over for longtime coach Karen Aston. Players recalled struggling to get to know each other and their coaches during video calls and limited practices, and said that has helped them bond and peak at the right time within the controlled environment set up for the tournament.,It was a relatively quiet night for South Carolina sophomore forward Aliyah Boston and Texas junior center Charli Collier, who had both averaged double-doubles this tournament and went head-to-head on Tuesday night. Boston, who is up for a few player-of-the-year awards, had 10 points and 8 rebounds; Collier, who is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, was held to 4 points after missing 8 of 10 shots.,Boston also had a slow start during South Carolina’s round-of-16 game against Georgia Tech but picked it up in the second half where she scored all 9 points. But in that game her teammates stepped in, led by Cooke on the perimeter with 17 points in a 76-65 win.,With its powerhouse defense, Texas was also able to hold No. 2 seed Maryland to its lowest score of the season in a , by limiting the Terrapins’ possessions and forcing 11 turnovers.,The fans helped too, Schaefer said. The university, located in Austin, is about 80 miles from San Antonio, the hub for the tournament where most of its games have been staged. “I thought our fans provided a great environment for both teams,” Schaefer said Monday.,South Carolina will play top-seeded Stanford. On Monday night, No. 1-seeded UConn and No. 3-seeded Arizona , to set up the other semifinal. Both semifinals are scheduled for Friday night."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/suez-canal-ship-costs.html,Clearing the Suez Canal Took Days. Figuring Out the Costs May Take Years.,"TOKYO — It took six days to , that ran aground and clogged the Suez Canal, one of the world’s most crucial shipping arteries. It could take years to sort out who will pay for the mess.,Cargo companies, insurers, government authorities and a phalanx of lawyers, all with different agendas and potential assessments, will need to determine not only the total damage but also what went wrong. When they eventually finish digging through the morass, the insurers of the ship’s Japanese owner are likely to bear the brunt of the financial pain.,The costs could add up quickly.,There are the repairs for any damage to the Ever Given, the quarter-mile-long ship that got stuck in the Suez. There is the bill for the tugboats and front-end loaders that dug the beached vessel out from the mud. The authority that operates the, has already said the crisis has cost the Egyptian government up to $90 million in lost toll revenue as hundreds of ships waited to pass through the blocked waterway or took other routes.,And the stalled ship , from moving through the canal, including cars, oil, livestock, laptops, sneakers, electronics and toilet paper. Companies delivering goods may have to pay customers for missed deadlines. If any agricultural goods went bad, producers may look to recoup lost revenue.,All of these cascading effects could amount to insurance claims in the hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as broader losses from the delays in the global supply chain.,The financial mess will ensnare a multinational web of businesses, led by the Japanese owner of the ship, its Taiwanese operator and the German management agent that hired the crew, as well as myriad cargo companies that rented space in the ship’s containers and a pool of insurance firms stretching from Tokyo to London.,The ultimate responsibility may fall to the insurers for the ship’s owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, a subsidiary of the 120-year-old privately owned Japanese shipbuilder Imabari.,Teams from the German company that hired the crew and a consortium of insurers for the ship’s owner are just starting to investigate what caused the marooning of the Ever Given. Authorities in Panama, where the ship is registered, are also conducting an inquiry, as are investigators for other interested parties. Their findings, whether they align or not, will complicate questions of liability, keeping claims adjusters and lawyers busy for years as they sort through the finger-pointing.,Investigators want to know “who was responsible for the disruption — was it the crew, the pilots working for the Suez Canal Authority, or is it just an act of nature or a freak accident by the wind?” said ,, an associate professor of supply chain management at the Curtin Business School in Perth, Australia. ,Even after inquiries are completed, “it’s not clear cut,” Mr. Oloruntoba added. “It all depends on how good the lawyers are and also the contracts that were entered into.”,The most straightforward aspect is the damage to the ship and the canal. In the shipping business, those costs usually fall to the insurers of the ship’s owner, in this case a consortium led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance in Tokyo with Tokio Marine and Sompo Japan. Initial reports indicate that the ship did not suffer much harm and that there was no pollution leak.,The consortium is also likely to be on the hook for the salvage costs to free the ship, which swelled as experts and equipment were mobilized on short notice. Robert Mazzuoli, an insurance analyst at Fitch Ratings, estimated that bill could run into the tens of millions, although there are many variables.,The trickier piece of the puzzle is the cargo. Companies that booked containers on the Ever Given, as well as some of the 400 ships that had to wait in line outside the canal while it was jammed, may want to file claims.,But most insurance policies do not cover the economic losses for cargo delays. So companies will have to make a specific case as to why they are entitled to compensation. ,Such claims could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.,The ships carrying the most time-sensitive cargo, such as livestock or produce, could make the strongest argument. Those vessels, though, were allowed to go through first once the waterway was cleared.,For the most part, claims around cargo might be “impractical,” said ,, a lawyer in Taipei who specializes in commercial and transportation law.,“While the ship is just parked there, the cargo isn’t actually being damaged,” Mr. Lee said. “The only damage is that it’s delayed.”,“Say I have a batch of cloth, and on top of the time it took to come to Taiwan, it got stuck for six or seven days,” he said. “It just sat there. Will it go bad? It won’t.” ,There is a caveat. The ship’s owner could have to pay for cargo delays, if its crew is found to be at fault for the accident.,Some so-called third-party claims related to delayed cargo may be covered by yet another insurer for the ship, the UK P&I Club. The same goes for any claims by the Suez Canal Authority, which operates the waterway and might file over any loss of revenue.,Nick Shaw, chief executive of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, the umbrella group that includes the UK P&I Club, said the insurer would “make decisions together with the shipowner as to which ones had validity and which ones are illegitimate.”,Adding to the complexity of the Suez accident are the layers upon layers of insurance. Reinsurers, companies that covers the risk of other insurance companies, come into play for claims above $100 million. Between insurance and reinsurance, the ship’s owner has coverage for those third-party claims up to $3.1 billion, although few experts believe the damages will run that high.,The sheer size of the Ever Given makes the situation all the more labyrinthine. Aside from time of war, the Suez Canal has never been blocked quite so spectacularly or for as long as it was by the Ever Given, and this is the biggest ship to run aground.,The ship is as long as the Empire State Building is tall, with the capacity to carry 20,000 containers stacked 12 to 14 high. The Ever Given is one of a fleet of 13 in a series designed by Imabari, part of a push to lower the costs per container and make the ships more competitive in an increasingly fierce market dominated by Chinese and South Korean shipbuilders.,“The bigger the ships get, the risk is whenever you have an incident like this is that you are putting more of your eggs into one basket,” said Simon Heaney, senior manager of container research at Drewry UK, a shipping consultancy. “So the claims will magnify.”,Raymond Zhong, and ,Amy Chang Chien, contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan. ,Vivian Yee, contributed from Cairo, and ,Makiko Inoue,, ,Hisako Ueno, and ,Hikari Hida, from Tokyo."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/football/nfl-adds-17th-regular-season-game.html,N.F.L. Officially Adds 17th Regular Season Game,"The N.F.L. formally agreed to add a 17th regular season game on Tuesday, the first expansion of the league’s schedule since 1978.,To make room for the extra game, the league’s owners removed one preseason game, leaving three for each team. The upcoming regular season will begin on Thursday, Sept. 9 and end one week later than usual, on Sunday, Jan. 9, 2022. Super Bowl LVI, which will be played in Inglewood, Calif., will also move back one week, to Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022.,Teams will continue to have only one bye week during the season.,Team owners approved the expansion at an annual meeting held virtually, but the new calendar structure had been all but guaranteed to move forward after the league announced on , with CBS, Fox and other media companies. The ,, reached in March 2020, gave team owners the option to add an extra regular season game if the league signed at least one new media deal.,With the addition of a 17th regular season game on top of the two extra playoff games the league added last season, the N.F.L. negotiated substantially higher rates for its media rights. The new deals, which total more than $100 billion, nearly double the amount of the expiring contracts.,“One of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world,” N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.,During negotiations on the labor contract last year, ,, opposed adding a 17th regular season game. The owners ultimately won over reluctant union members, who approved the agreement by just 60 votes, with players getting a bump in their share of the N.F.L.’s revenue, up to 48.5 percent from 47 under the old deal.,Some players remain opposed to a longer season. Denver Broncos safety Kareem Jackson called the ,. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara ,to convey his displeasure, before tempering his reaction by,, “17 games still dumb,” on the app.,Goodell said in a conference call with reporters that players would still play a total of 20 preseason and regular season games. Injury rates, he said, are higher during preseason games, so eliminating one could lead to fewer injuries. Most established players, though, play only sparingly during the preseason, when coaches prefer to evaluate free agents and rookies as they vie for roster spots.,On Tuesday, the owners also approved a rule that would require all 32 teams to play an overseas game at least once every eight years. This will allow the league to schedule up to four neutral-site games each year outside the United States starting in 2022. Teams like the Green Bay Packers have been reluctant to play internationally because they did not want to give up the revenue from a home game and because of the stress of additional travel. In recent years, some franchises have been willing to play games in London and in Mexico City in exchange for the right to host a Super Bowl. The new rule would end that trade-off.,As the league looks to grow the game’s international footprint, N.F.L. executives said it may also return to playing games in Canada, as well as in South America and elsewhere in Europe, including Germany. Chris Halpin, the N.F.L.’s chief strategy and growth officer, said finding a Canadian stadium that meets the league’s specifications for hosting a game remains an issue.,The 17-game regular season will give half of the N.F.L.’s teams an extra home game each season. For simplicity’s sake, the 17th game will be hosted by all teams from one conference on a rotating basis. In 2021, every A.F.C. team will host nine regular season games, while N.F.C. teams will host eight. In 2022, N.F.C. teams will get the ninth home game.,As usual, teams will play home and away against their three divisional rivals for a total of six games. Interdivisional games within the same conference will continue on a rotating, three-year cycle, interconference games, on a four-year cycle. Remaining games will be determined based on the prior year’s standings.,The newly added 17th game will be between interconference teams based on the prior year’s standings. A first-place team from one division will face a first-place team from a division in the opposing conference that it had not been scheduled to play based on the usual scheduling rotations.,That will lead to some intriguing interconference games in 2021. The Green Bay Packers, for instance, winners of the NF.C. North last season, will travel to Kansas City to play the Chiefs, who won the A.F.C. West. The Seattle Seahawks, winners of the N.F.C. West, will play the Steelers in Pittsburgh, while the , will play the Colts in Indianapolis.,The N.F.L. will announce the dates and times of all these games in the coming weeks."

That muted response drew fierce criticism, as well as protests at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and calls for a boycott.,But on Wednesday, Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, made a stark reversal. “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values,” he wrote in an internal memo that was reviewed by The New York Times.,Coca-Cola, another of Georgia’s largest companies, which had also declined to take a position on the legislation before it passed, made a similarly worded statement.,“I want to be crystal clear,” said James Quincey, Coca-Cola’s chief executive. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.”,Less than a day before the abrupt reversals, a group of prominent Black executives ,to publicly oppose a wave of similarly restrictive voting bills that Republicans are advancing in almost every state.,But the statements won’t change the outcome in Georgia, where the new law introduced stricter voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited drop boxes in predominantly Black neighborhoods and expanded the legislature’s power over elections.,“It is regrettable that the sense of urgency came after the legislation was passed and signed into law,” said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at Ralph Lauren, Pepsi and Square.,Mr. Bastian decided to write the memo and revise the company’s position on Tuesday night after speaking with Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express who helped organize ,, according to three people familiar with the conversation.,In the memo, Mr. Bastian said it was only after the law was passed that he truly understood the degree to which it would impose restrictions on Black voters.,“After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it’s evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives,” he said. “That is wrong.”,Mr. Bastian went further, saying the new law was based on false pretenses.,“The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections,” he said. “This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.”,Several other companies also weighed in on the issue on Wednesday.,Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, issued a statement on , saying the company was concerned about the wave of new restrictive voting laws. “BlackRock is concerned about efforts that could limit access to the ballot for anyone,” Mr. Fink said. “Voting should be easy and accessible for ALL eligible voters.”,Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citi, in a post on ,, called out the Georgia law as discriminatory.,“I am appalled by the recent voter suppression laws passed in the state of Georgia,” said Mr. Mason, who is Black. “I see it as a disgrace that our country’s efforts to keep Black Americans from engaging fully in our Constitutional right to vote continue to this day.”,Chuck Robbins, who is the chief executive of Cisco and grew up in Georgia, , on Twitter that “voting is a fundamental right in our democracy” and that “governments should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder.”,And Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote a , about the Georgia law, detailing what he saw as the legislation’s failings and suggesting that corporate America try to get it changed.,“We hope that companies will come together and make clear that a healthy business requires a healthy community,” Mr. Smith said. “And a healthy community requires that everyone have the right to vote conveniently, safely, and securely. This new law falls short of the mark, and we should work together to press the Georgia legislature to change it.”,Andrew Ross Sorkin, contributed reporting."

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/skiing/mikaela-shiffrin-skiing-olympics.html,Mikaela Shiffrin Is Not Going Downhill,"Mikaela Shiffrin, the two-time Olympic Alpine champion, stopped competing 13 months ago, an absence tied to the accidental , and later extended by the coronavirus pandemic and a back injury sustained in training.,Shiffrin returned to the start gate in December and in the next four months won three World Cup races and four medals in the world championships, the latter , for most career medals (11) and victories (six) at the event.,It was a successful winter by any measure, except perhaps Shiffrin’s recent past: In the 2018-19 season, she finished with an astonishing 17 World Cup victories. So it was not a surprise to Shiffrin that her statistical decline this season was much noted in the ski community, but she did not like all that she heard.,“One of the things that bugged me was so many people saying, ‘Oh, she’s lost it,’” Shiffrin said in a telephone interview from Europe last week. “You know, I’m still here, I’m still doing it.”,Shiffrin chuckled.,“It’s true it wasn’t as good a year as I’ve had in the past,” she said, adding that many people around the world, not just ski racers, could say the same thing about the previous 12 months. “But when I look back at this season I’ll be proud. I didn’t even know if there was going to be a World Cup or if I was emotionally ready for it. Then I was injured as the racing was starting, and in bed and not training. I felt like I was playing catch-up.”,Ultimately, her 300-day layoff and atypical results have provided Shiffrin with something significant as the 2022 Beijing Olympics approach: new incentive.,“I’m motivated from what was lacking this year,” Shiffrin, 26, said. “There’s some missing pieces. That’s one of my biggest goals — to get those back.”,Shiffrin said the best example of her renewed drive was her presence last week on the slopes of the Kuhtai Ski Resort in Austria, where she tested dozens of new skis not far from the headquarters of her equipment sponsor, Atomic. In previous years, after a demanding 21-race World Cup schedule in nine countries, she might have dashed home, as most North American skiers did when racing ended March 21.,“But this year, I want to stay here because I’m excited to do the work,” said Shiffrin, whose 69 World Cup victories rank third all time behind Ingemar Stenmark’s 86 and Lindsey Vonn’s 82. “And that’s a good place to be. I’m looking forward to all the off-season training I can get.”,Though the Beijing Olympics are 11 months away, they are already on her mind. Since Shiffrin is the rare athlete with the versatility to compete in each of the five Alpine events, she must soon decide whether to arrange the extensive spring and summer training needed to prepare for each race.,Then there is the uncertainty of the pandemic’s effect on the availability of on-snow training. Most years, Shiffrin would travel to practice in South America or New Zealand — or both — as well as in California and Colorado. Last summer, she was confined to the western United States.,For now, Shiffrin has not decided which races to enter at the Winter Games. She did not, for example, compete in a downhill race this past season, although her back injury in early October and the restricted training opportunities most likely contributed to that decision.,“I’m trying to decide what I want to ski in the Olympics and where I have the potential to be a medal contender,” Shiffrin said. “You have to be prepared before the next World Cup season starts because there’s a million things that can get in the way leading up to the Olympics.”,The Beijing Games will be Shiffrin’s third Olympics, but unlike in the period ahead of the 2014 Sochi Games and the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics she has not skied on the mountain racecourses outside Beijing that will be used for the Alpine competitions. It is customary for test events to be staged at an Olympic venue a year or more in advance, but the ski areas outside Beijing get little natural snow — and the pandemic led to the suspension of travel and planning. Few top racers have skied at, or even visited, the Beijing sites.,“Nobody’s seen it,” Shiffrin said, “and that’s definitely going to add a layer of chaos when we arrive for the first time at the Games. Like, where do we go? What’s happening here?”,Shiffrin is encouraged that the focus on American Olympic ski racing prospects will be more diffuse than it was in 2018, when attention was reserved almost exclusively for her and the now-retired Vonn. Several of Shiffrin’s American teammates had breakout performances this winter, including Paula Moltzan, 26, who placed in the top 10 of the last three World Cup slalom races of the season. Moltzan’s teammate, Nina O’Brien, 23, finished 17th in the season-long giant slalom standings.,In December, Ryan Cochran-Siegle, the son of the 1972 Olympic Alpine gold medalist Barbara Cochran, became the first American man to win a World Cup super-G in 15 years.,“The team has shown a level of depth and consistency,” Shiffrin said, “that I haven’t experienced in my career.”,Next week, Shiffrin expects to head back to her home in Colorado, changed by the past 13 months.,On Feb. 2, 2020, her father, Jeff Shiffrin, an anesthesiologist in Denver, died at 65 from what a coroner ruled a home accident, listing the cause of death as a head injury.,“My life was flipped upside down and inside out,” Shiffrin said. “And never mind me, there was a pandemic. It changes your perspective.”,Noting that she has been on the World Cup circuit for 11 seasons, Shiffrin added: “A sort of staleness could have set in, but I feel lucky to do this and to have people around me who have given so much of themselves to help me be good at it.,“And I have a sense of wanting to figure out what I want to do better. Because I want to do better.”"

It was a land of envelopes stuffed with cash, sham jobs and recruiters bearing more gifts than Santa Claus. At one point, six schools were on N.C.A.A. probation, ,, and the string of scandals ensnared even a governor of Texas and a Texas A&M trustee who was a part owner of the Dallas Cowboys.,The league was also where nobody paid much attention to basketball.,The ,, a victim of its own excesses and the musical chairs of conference realignment, its members scattered across the college landscape. But for those who might carry some nostalgia for those wild (south)west days, this year’s Final Four is going to pull at the heartstrings the way boosters used to pull out wads of cash.,Two camps of the diaspora will come together in one national semifinal on Saturday after Houston ended a remarkable run by the No. 12 seed Oregon State with , in the Midwest regional final on Monday. The No. 2-seeded Cougars will play an old colleague, Baylor. The Bears, now in the Big 12, dispatched another Southwest alum, Arkansas, now in the Southeastern Conference, to win the South regional final, 81-72.,Baylor, a top seed, jumped to an early 18-point lead on its deadeye 3-point shooting and fended off the resilient Razorbacks down the stretch, clinching its first Final Four appearance since 1950.,The Cougars, who are in the Final Four for the time since 1984, had a more stressful time getting there. They blew a 17-point halftime lead but Quentin Grimes steadied them, hitting a 3-pointer from the top of the arc with 3 minutes, 21 seconds left, putting Houston ahead to stay.,“One thing you have to remind people, young men in these situations — don’t be afraid to fail,” Coach Kelvin Sampson said, recalling what he told his team during a timeout after Oregon State had tied the score. “Don’t be afraid to miss the shot. You certainly can’t be afraid to take it.”,The Cougars (28-3), who rallied from a 10-point, second-half deficit to beat No. 10-seeded Rutgers in the second round, have navigated a wrecked bracket, facing the 15th, 10th, 11th and 12th seeds. Their latest opponent, Oregon State (20-13), was trying to become the lowest seed to reach the Final Four.,Houston has a rich basketball history, dating to the 1960s when Elvin Hayes fueled a team that threatened U.C.L.A.’s dynasty and carrying through to the mid-1980s, when , — led by the future Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler — went to three consecutive Final Fours, losing back-to-back title games.,Much has happened since then. Little of it has been good for the Cougars.,Relegated to Conference USA once the Southwest disbanded in 1996 and then moving to the American Athletic Conference, Houston had little success fulfilling its athletic ambitions to rival big brother schools like Texas and Texas A&M. It hired Drexler as coach, but he flopped and left after two seasons.,One swing, though, has paid off — hiring Sampson, a sage but scandal-ridden coach. He drew the financial backing of Tilman Fertitta, the restaurant and casino mogul who owns the Houston Rockets. He poured $20 million into a campaign to renovate the Cougars’ Hofheinz Pavilion, now known as the Fertitta Center.,Sampson, who in 2018 led Houston to its first tournament-game victory in 34 years, now has the Cougars in position to win their first championship — and he would do it as an outsider.,The only team from outside the Power 6 conferences to win a championship since U.N.L.V. in 1990 was Connecticut in 2014, after its first season in the American after spending decades in the Big East. Houston fits that profile well with a band of transfers and overlooked talent.,Six Cougars, including four starters, began their careers elsewhere — ,, an acclaimed recruit who marked his arrival in college basketball at Kansas by scoring a game-high 21 points in a win over a Michigan State team that ended up in the Final Four.,But Grimes, not as comfortable as he wanted to be, returned home to Houston.,Sampson has been able to pitch a track record of development, burnished by six years he spent as an N.B.A. assistant, though that stint was essentially an exile after he landed Oklahoma and then Indiana on probation for violating N.C.A.A. rules. If this is a redemptive turn, it comes an hour’s drive north of where he was fired more than a decade ago.,If Sampson has rarely had elite talent, he has consistently built winners around hard-nosed ballplayers who build a fortress around the basket they are defending. In his 27 previous seasons as a head coach — at Washington State, Oklahoma, Indiana and Houston — that had been good enough to regularly reach the N.C.A.A. tournament but for just one trip to the Final Four, in 2002 with Oklahoma. The backcourt pair from that team — Hollis Price and Quannas White — are on his staff with the Cougars.,They were surely nodding with approval on Monday night as the Cougars took space away from Oregon State’s floor full of shooters, leaving them flustered. Price and White had to be particularly pleased with DeJon Jarreau, a sinewy 6-foot-5 guard who, like them, is from New Orleans.,A transfer from Massachusetts who spent a year at a community college, Jarreau had 10 points, 8 assists and 8 rebounds, but his best work may have been on defense. He was named the tournament’s most outstanding player. He badgered Ethan Thompson, who had scored 48 points in the previous two games and had been particularly adept at getting to the free-throw line, where he had made 25 of 26 shots in the tournament. On Monday, Thompson was limited to 11 points, though he contributed 7 rebounds and 6 assists to fuel Oregon State’s late charge.,“Man, it’s like a dream come true,” said Jarreau, who is at his third school with his best friend, reserve forward Brison Gresham. “Growing up, watching the Final Four, watching college basketball, you always think about getting to this point, seeing former players on TV do this. Like I said, as a kid, I’m watching TV growing up, and I’m like I hope I’ll be here one day, and man, I’m really here.”,There were similar sentiments when Baylor clinched its berth just after midnight.,As Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” blared, players bounced around the court, hugged and mugged for selfies, and eventually took turns snipping the nets from the rims.,But in this pandemic season, it was a markedly different celebration. There were only several hundred Baylor fans there to share in the merrymaking, and the traditional confetti shower was a do-it-yourself exercise. The Bears grabbed handfuls from a bucket and tossed them in the air.,As the confetti fluttered down, a portion of the court recalled those days in the Southwest Conference, for it was awash in green."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/sports/ncaabasketball/uconn-baylor-elite-eight.html,UConn Reaches Final Four With Tight Win Over Baylor,"SAN ANTONIO — The Final Four of the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament, it seems, came early — UConn sneaking past Baylor, 69-67, in a game between championship pedigrees that looked much more like a title slugfest than a test in the round of 8.,The Huskies used a 19-point run that started late in the third quarter to surge ahead, then held on for their tournament life until the final possession, when their freshman star , snagged the Bears’ final inbound pass to seal the win, securing UConn’s 13th consecutive trip to the Final Four.,On the other side of the Alamodome, which is divided into two courts, Arizona edged Indiana, 66-53, in a physical game that included a game-stopping altercation between the players. The Wildcats earned their first trip to the Final Four.,UConn has won the championship 11 times under Coach Geno Auriemma, who was mobbed by his team with paper confetti as he gave a postgame interview following the win.,Bueckers scored 28 points, asserting her presence early and then taking over again late as UConn turned back a determined Baylor team.,“Just to be a part of that history, that’s why I came here,” Bueckers said in a postgame interview.,Baylor held a 2-point lead going into the final quarter. The Bears repeatedly kept UConn from taking easy shots, knocking jumpers out of bounds and securing the ball off the glass to keep control. DiJonai Carrington served as her team’s main disruptive force off the bench, leading with 22 points, 7 rebounds and 2 steals and making numerous plays on defense to keep UConn from getting into a flow.,DiDi Richards, the 2020 Naismith defensive player of the year, went down clutching her left hamstring at the end of the third, and UConn started to close the gap. By the time Richards returned to the game, UConn had gained an advantage.,“The whole story of the game is DiDi Richards goes down and the whole momentum shifted,” Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey said.,The Huskies took the lead on a second-chance layup by Aaliyah Edwards with less than nine minutes left. Bueckers followed up with two jumpers, but the teams repeatedly fouled one another to inch the score up point by point. Two free throws with 19 seconds left by Carrington put Baylor back within a point of the win.,On Baylor’s penultimate possession, Carrington drove to the basket and wanted a foul to be called, but the referees did not blow the whistle and Baylor’s players were so frustrated that they delayed fouling as crucial time ticked away. “It’s a tough way to end a game,” Carrington said after the game. “Really frustrating, pictures don’t lie, tape don’t lie.”,It was UConn’s defense that came through at the end — the Bears missed their last four field goal attempts — to deliver yet another Final Four.,“This was harder than winning some of the national championships that we’ve won,” Auriemma said.,Mulkey had predicted correctly that the game could be “ugly,” with both teams scoring less than they were used to and turning the ball over more often.,The all-star matchup came a few months late: The Huskies were set to visit the Bears in Waco, Texas, in January before ,.,The last time the teams met was in January 2020, when the Bears — the reigning champion after , — walked away with a 74-58 win and ,. A year earlier, Baylor broke UConn’s ,.,Headed into their regional final, UConn and Baylor had met eight times, and ,.,“I wish it was for the national championship and not a chance to get to a Final Four because I think both programs are just elite and it’s a shame somebody has to lose,” Mulkey told reporters on Sunday.,Their matchup happening this early in the tournament was in part a credit to the depth at the top of the 64-team field, with Baylor as one of several formidable teams seeded second who could certainly be considered title contenders. Already in this tournament, some teams at the top have been tested, and one No. 1 seed, North Carolina State, ,.,“Explain to me how they are a No. 2 seed,” Auriemma said of Baylor on Sunday. “These things happen, I know, but I think they deserved to be an No. 1 seed, if you look around the rest of the tournament.”,To reach the round of 8, Baylor blew past its first- and second-round opponents but needed overtime to prevail against Michigan in the regional semifinal, 78-75.,Its best player this tournament has been NaLyssa Smith, a junior forward from Converse, Texas, who had made 26 of her 33 shots this tournament leading up to Monday’s game, including all 11 she took in Baylor’s round of 16 win. Against UConn, she had 14 points.,UConn has delivered three clear wins in this tournament, its first two without Auriemma present after he contracted the coronavirus. The Huskies won in the round of 16 by containing Caitlin Clark, the leading scorer in Division I, and Iowa in a 92-72 victory on Saturday. Bueckers has been the buzz for the Huskies — posting 62 points, 23 rebounds and 18 assists in their first three tournament games — but Saturday’s game reminded opponents that UConn’s depth is its true weapon.,Indiana gave Arizona a run for its money in a low-scoring game. After trailing throughout the third quarter, the Hoosiers tied the game going into the fourth thanks to a second-chance pull-up jumper by Aleksa Gulbe.,But Indiana missed its last three shots — and all nine of its 3-point attempts in the game.,Aari McDonald, Arizona’s leader who has a streak of 91 games scoring at least 10 points, had game highs of 33 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists. She was walked off the court with less than three minutes to play to have her left ankle wrapped after a fall, but she returned to deliver a driving layup on a fast break and several free throws without a sign of pain. Her final free throw was the last bit of action before her teammates and coaches swarmed the court with a bucket of confetti.,On Tuesday night, top-seeded South Carolina faces No. 6 seed Texas while Stanford, another top seed, plays No. 2 seed Louisville for the other two spots in the national semifinals scheduled for Friday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-final-four-preview.html,N.C.A.A. Women’s Final Four: A First-Timer Crashes a Group of Powers,"The women’s basketball Final Four has all the narratives a fan could want.,A dynastic Connecticut program looking to reclaim its spot at the top. A traditionally great Stanford program aiming to recapture its former glory. South Carolina, the nation’s newest power, is establishing itself as a perennial contender. And Arizona, the Final Four first-timer, is working to make its mark.,If you missed this week’s games, and even if you didn’t, here’s a primer on what to look forward to in Friday’s national semifinals, where Stanford will play South Carolina before UConn faces Arizona.,It is probably a surprise to no one that Connecticut is in the Final Four. But predictably or not, and for the 13th consecutive season, Coach Geno Auriemma and his team are competing in the national semifinals after eking out a round of 8 win over Baylor. The Bears had led the Huskies by as many as 10 points, but crumbled after losing arguably their most important player, the national defensive player of the year DiDi Richards, to a hamstring injury late in the third quarter.,The Huskies’ close win showed the team’s strengths, and where the young squad and its freshman starters still occasionally stumble. First among those strengths is the freshman Paige Bueckers, who scored 28 points in the victory over Baylor, and has averaged 22.5 points in four tournament games.,“Paige does a lot of things that you can’t explain,” Auriemma said. “There are a lot of things that Paige has to learn, that she doesn’t handle so great right now. But like all great players, she can sense the moment, and she has the ability to fill that moment.”,The biggest boost for Connecticut so far in the tournament, though, has been the top-tier play of those around Bueckers. Christyn Williams and Evina Westbrook have given the team a boost from behind the 3-point line, and the 6-foot-4 Olivia Nelson-Ododa has become an unlikely distributor, with 11 assists in her past two games.,It has been five years since Connecticut’s last title, as long of a gap as the program has had between championships since it won its first in 1995. .,Arizona’s first trip to the Final Four has come courtesy of Aari McDonald, its star senior guard, who poured in 64 points in wins over Texas A&M and Indiana this week and has been an unstoppable force on both ends of the floor.,“When you know, you know you’re feeling it,” McDonald told reporters after the game. “I wasn’t doing too well in the regular season, taking bad shots and stuff. But now I’m really just taking what the defense is giving me.”,While McDonald, the Pac-12 player of the year, has led the way offensively, forward Trinity Baptiste has given the team some much-needed size and even contributed a double-double against Indiana. The Wildcats play a relentless, high-energy defense that forces a lot of turnovers, especially against teams that underestimate them.,“We just need this confidence and momentum going into UConn,” McDonald said. “UConn, we already know what they’re about: powerhouse, well-coached, skillful players. But hey, I got my chances with my teammates. Ride or die, I’m going to war with them.”,When South Carolina won its first national title in 2017, the Gamecocks had the best player in the country in A’ja Wilson, the 2020 W.N.B.A. most valuable player. Coach Dawn Staley’s team looked ready to claim another trophy last season, going 32-1 behind a group of young talent that — while it didn’t yet have, S.C. — looked good enough to deserve one.,Then the pandemic hit, and the Gamecocks’ momentum was (temporarily) halted. This season, South Carolina lost four times — all to ranked teams, and while still showing some of the immaturity of its young core.,“When we got knocked down four times this season, they got back up stronger, and I like that,” Staley said after Tuesday’s win against Texas sent her team back to the Final Four. “They haven’t even scratched the surface of how good they can be. We’re happy, but we’re not done yet.”,The 6-foot-5 center Aliyah Boston typically fuels both the defense and the offense, scoring efficiently under the basket, but increasingly South Carolina’s quick guards have stepped into starring roles. The junior Destanni Henderson and the sophomore Zia Cooke are scoring threats anywhere on the floor, and the Gamecocks are playing their best basketball of the season.,Stanford breezed through its first three tournament games, barely breaking a sweat as they hit 43 3-pointers. Then they met up with a scrappy Louisville team on Tuesday that spent more than half of the game in the lead; at one point in the third quarter, Louisville led by 14 points.,But Stanford rallied behind its typically balanced shooting. Bench players like the 6-foot-5 sophomore Ashten Prechtel, who played only 16 minutes but made all six of her shots, offered key contributions when shots by Stanford’s senior leader, Kiana Williams, weren’t falling.,Stanford, the top overall seed in this year’s tournament, regained its footing because it has so many players who can shoot. Even in a game when it wasn’t scoring confidently, the Cardinal still made seven 3-pointers.,“I just had to change my mentality,” Williams said after Stanford rallied to claim its 14th Final Four appearance under ,. “I was forcing things — I think I wanted it too bad. Once I got that first shot to go in, it started going from there.”,Facing a big tournament test against Louisville has likely better equipped the Cardinal what’s to come against South Carolina on Friday. Now, the challenge for Stanford will be whether its defense can stifle a team with as many skillful shooters as its own."

But on the first try, fans weren’t in a hurry to pack the stands. Those who did make the trip saw the Rangers lose, 4-0.,Eager to see baseball again, Sara Lambin, 42, drove about three hours from Georgetown, Texas, with her two kids for Monday night’s game — the first time she and her family had seen live baseball in more than a year.,Lambin said she saw a dozen spring training games in Surprise, Ariz., last year before M.L.B., like all other sports leagues, shut down.,“It’s almost like a lull. We’re just ready for it,” Lambin said, sitting 17 rows behind home plate.,In coming to the exhibition game, Lambin said she hoped to beat what will likely be a much larger crowd when the Rangers play their home opener against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5.,“If this were to fill up, I don’t think I’d be that comfortable,” Lambin said. “We would leave.”,Others, like Porter Burns, 22, were less concerned with the size of crowd.,“In Texas, I have the freedom,” Burns said as he watched batting practice before the game. “Because I’m vaccinated, I’m not afraid at all.”,Even though there were no capacity restrictions, Burns said he felt the Rangers still had too many rules in place, lamenting that he wasn’t allowed to bring his backpack into the ballpark.,Still, he said he appreciated a chance to see the ballpark before most fans did.,“I wanted to come out here early just to see it without all the people,” Burns said.,While the Rangers played all 30 home games without fans last season, Monday’s game did not mark the first time Globe Life Field was open to spectators. Last summer, the park hosted ,. In the fall, it was open to about 11,500 fans per game for the National League Championship Series and the World Series. In December, it hosted the National Finals Rodeo and a holiday lights display.,Texas has been fully open since March 10 after , mandate and announced that any business could open to 100 percent.,“Make no mistake, Covid-19 has not disappeared,” Abbott said in a statement earlier this month, adding that Texans should continue to observe safe practices. “Each person has a role to play in their own personal safety and the safety of others.”,A number of precautions remained in place Monday night at Globe Life Field, just as they will at other major league parks: Masks were required for all fans, unless they were eating or drinking. Hand-sanitizing stations were available throughout the ballpark. Concessions were cashless, and stickers reading “Do Your Part Stay 6 Feet Apart” were spread throughout the ballpark at concession stands.,Watching the game from behind first base, Travis Scarangello, 27, said he trusted other fans to take the appropriate precautions.,“As long as people are wearing masks, I don’t think I’m going to get sick,” Scarangello said, adding that he drove more than three hours from Austin to see Monday night’s game.,Keeping a safe distance was easier in some parts of the park than others. Some sections were completely empty, while dozens of fans sat together in portions of right field.,Bryan Dunne, 28, said he felt the safety protocols were a small price to pay to see baseball again in person.,“We had a year off,” Dunne said, adding that before the pandemic he would typically attend 20 games per season. “I’m just happy to be back.”,Aside from the Rangers’ home opener, teams across M.L.B. will not be , to start the season.

Men’s Final Four: An Early Look,"With some blowouts and plenty of busted brackets, we have arrived at the , men’s Final Four. And the semifinal matchups promise some good story lines with a Texas intrastate clash and a top-seeded juggernaut facing one of the last teams selected to be in the field of 68.,The four that remain: , and ,. Here’s a look at each team’s strengths and weaknesses ahead of their semifinals on Saturday.,After its 81-72 win against Arkansas, Baylor (28-3) made it to its first Final Four since 1950 and the Bears look as ready as ever. The Bears, the top seed in the South region, are a strong defensive team that is going to give Houston its most challenging matchup in the tournament. The Bears also have great 3-point shooting — the best in the men’s game at 41 percent.,Baylor is led by three skilled guards — Jared Butler, MaCio Teague and Davion Mitchell — who combine to score 46.5 of the team’s 83 average points per game.,The important thing for Baylor is to take advantage of its shooting strengths. Houston’s defense is a hard one to get past, but Baylor has the shooters to do it. They just have to make the shots.,Baylor struggles with turnovers, averaging 11.7 per game. That carelessness with the ball sometimes hurts the Bears, like it did when they allowed Arkansas to make a comeback from 17 points down. Houston’s elite and quick defense could take advantage if that happens again.,Defense, defense, defense — No. 2-seeded Houston (28-3) out of the Midwest region is great at it. The Cougars are making their first Final Four appearance since 1984 and looking like a team ready and able to stop any offense in its path. Houston is able to close in quick and force turnovers, making it the second best defense in men’s Division I, holding opponents to just 57.6 points per game.,Houston is led by Quentin Grimes, a transfer from Kansas who has found much success with the Cougars. Grimes averages 18 points and 5.8 rebounds and is key to the team’s offensive strategy.,The Cougars are also a great rebounding team, which will be particularly important against Baylor’s 3-point shooting to take those second-chance points away from the Bears.,Houston has to be able to either set the pace of the game or keep up with Baylor on the offensive end. It is clearly a strong team when it comes to preventing its opponents from making shots, but Houston still must make its own.,Grimes is important for the Cougars offense, but he isn’t all of it, and can’t be if Houston expects to beat Baylor.,Undefeated No. 1-seeded Gonzaga (30-0) is not the team to make mistakes around. The Bulldogs, who easily won the West region, are dominant because they take advantage of turnover opportunities to score. This team also shares the ball well, averaging 18.6 assists.,The Bulldogs also score an average of 91.8 points per game — the most of any men’s team in Division I. They are extremely efficient, push the pace and can keep up with any kind of defense.,Gonzaga is led by Corey Kispert, who averages 19 points. Close behind is Drew Timme, averaging 18.9 points and 7.2 rebounds — he has scored a combined 45 points in the last two games. He is one of the most multifaceted players in college basketball and is one of several pro prospects among the Bulldogs.,No one has shown itself able to really threaten the Zags in their attempt to be the first undefeated champion since Indiana in 1976. It will be a big challenge for U.C.L.A. to get in the way.,Gonzaga is good, if not great, at most things. It made Southern California look completely outclassed on Tuesday night and showed some well-earned swagger in the process. But U.C.L.A. has toppled plenty of other teams in this tournament, including top-seeded Michigan.,U.C.L.A., a No. 11 seed who had to play a First Four game just to enter the round of 64, is easily the surprise of this semifinal quartet after winning the East region. Coach Mick Cronin has no players with previous N.C.A.A. tournament experience on his roster. The Bruins are here for the first time since 2008, and are the second team to go from a play-in game to the Final Four.,The Bruins have had quite a path here, playing in two overtime games, including in the First Four against Michigan State. Upsetting Michigan, 51-49, they found a way to force the Wolverines into turnovers and take advantage. If the Bruins have proved anything in this tournament, it is resilience.,U.C.L.A. is a talented 3-point shooting team at 37.2 percent. Johnny Juzang averages 15 points and 4.1 rebounds, and he has continued to contribute in big ways even while contending with an ankle injury during the postseason. He scored 28 points in the round of 8 win.,“Nobody picked this, nobody believed in us,” Cronin said in a sideline interview after the win against Michigan. “That’s how we like it.”,The U.C.L.A. bench had no points in its win against Michigan. Its lack of depth could be a big problem against the versatile Bulldogs. If the Bruins don’t get contributions beyond their starters, they will have an even steeper climb keeping up with Gonzaga’s quick offense.,The Bruins have also struggled from the free throw line in their last few games which could cause problems, especially if they are being forced to drive instead of taking shots from behind the arc.,It is no secret that the Bruins are going to have to play the best game of their season to compete with Gonzaga, but they have been full of surprises this postseason."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/supreme-court-ncaa.html,Supreme Court Seems Ready to Back Payments to Student-Athletes,"WASHINGTON — Justices across the ideological spectrum teamed up during , on Wednesday to voice skepticism about the N.C.A.A.’s position that it could bar relatively modest payments to student-athletes in the name of amateurism despite the antitrust laws. But some of the same justices also seemed worried about opening the floodgates to further challenges.,Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes,” adding that he doubted that college sports fans understood amateurism to require it.,“To pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing,” he said, seems “entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing.”,Justice Clarence Thomas noted that other participants in college sports are paid enormous sums. “It just strikes me as odd that the coaches’ salaries have ballooned,” he said, “and they’re in the amateur ranks, as are the players.”,By contrast, Justice Elena Kagan said, colleges and universities have used their combined market power “to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels, far lower than what the market would set if it were allowed to operate.”,A ruling in favor of the education-related payments at issue in the case would be among the largest breakthroughs to date in the effort to pay college athletes, which has gained momentum in recent years as one state after another considers proposals to allow them to profit from their fame. It would also be yet another blow to the N.C.A.A., which has found its business model increasingly under siege and has argued that payments would effectively professionalize students.,Though there seemed to be something like a consensus for the payments at issue, several justices said they were concerned that such a ruling would prompt a deluge of other challenges.,“How do we know,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, “that we’re not just destroying the game as it exists?”,Justice Stephen G. Breyer added, “I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run.”,Last year, a , that the N.C.A.A. was not free to limit benefits tied to education for Division I football and basketball players. The decision allowed payments for things like musical instruments, scientific equipment, postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad, academic awards and internships. It did not permit the outright payment of salaries.,The court rejected the N.C.A.A.’s argument that compensating athletes would alienate sports fans who prize students’ amateur status. “Uncapping certain education-related benefits would preserve consumer demand for college athletics just as well as the challenged rules do,” Chief Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.,“Such benefits are easily distinguishable from professional salaries,” he wrote, as they are linked to education and could be provided in kind rather than in cash. “The record furnishes ample support,” Judge Thomas added, “that the provision of education-related benefits has not and will not repel college sports fans.”,At the argument on Wednesday, Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for the N.C.A.A., said “these new allowances are akin to professional salaries.”,Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. responded that some of the payments the association already allows had a similar character.,“Schools can pay up to $50,000 for a $10 million insurance policy to protect student-athletes for future earnings,” he said. “Now that sounds very much like pay for play.”,Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., drawing on briefs supporting the players, painted a bleak picture of athletes’ lives and futures.,“They face training requirements that leave little time or energy for study, constant pressure to put sports above study, pressure to drop out of hard majors and hard classes, really shockingly low graduation rates,” he said. “Only a tiny percentage ever go on to make any money in professional sports.”,“So the argument is they are recruited, they’re used up, and then they’re cast aside without even a college degree,” he said. “How can this be defended in the name of amateurism?”,Mr. Waxman said the alternative would be worse. “If you allow them to be paid,” he said, “they will be spending even more time on their athletics and devoting even less attention to academics.”,Justice Alito said the athletes were already paid. “They get lower admission standards,” he said. “They get tuition, room and board, and other things. That’s a form of pay. So the distinction is not whether they’re going to be paid. It’s the form in which they’re going to be paid and how much they’re going to be paid.”,Mr. Waxman said paid internships posed particular hazards because they could involve unlimited sums.,Justice Sotomayor responded that the N.C.A.A. remained free to set limits. “If you think that internships should be related in some way to the educational experience,” she said, “you could pass rules to that effect.”,Justice Thomas said that paying athletes “sounds fine for the upper-level schools, whether it’s, you know, Alabama, Ohio State and Nebraska.” But he said he was worried that “the bigger schools would begin to cherry-pick with the transfer portal the athletes from the lower schools simply because they’re able to afford this income.”,Jeffrey L. Kessler, a lawyer for Shawne Alston, a former West Virginia University running back, and other student-athletes challenging the N.C.A.A.’s rules, said that “those schools don’t compete now.”,“Alabama pays its weight coaches $700,000 a year,” he said. “None of those small schools can do that.”,The Supreme Court last considered how antitrust laws applied to the association in 1984, ruling that its restrictions on television coverage of college football games were unlawful. But the decision, ,, included an influential passage on student-athletes.,“The N.C.A.A. plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports,” , wrote for the majority. “There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role, or that the preservation of the student-athlete in higher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of” the antitrust laws.,The Biden administration filed a brief supporting the athletes in the new case, ,, No. 20-512, saying that the Ninth Circuit had struck the right balance.,“The court was focused on legitimate educational expenses,” Elizabeth B. Prelogar, the acting solicitor general, told the justices on Wednesday.,Besides the coronavirus pandemic, no issue has recently demanded more of the N.C.A.A.’s attention than the rights of student-athletes, especially whether they should be able to profit from their fame. College sports executives have long feared that loosening age-old rules would open a different array of challenges, but they have faced mounting pressure over the past few years from Congress and many of the nation’s statehouses.,Most crucially, a Florida law that directly challenges the N.C.A.A.’s policies is scheduled to take effect this summer, and California legislators are considering a proposal to speed up a similar measure there.,Although the N.C.A.A. has vowed to rewrite its rules, it delayed final approval over the winter after the Trump administration’s Justice Department raised misgivings. And Congress has not rushed to give the association the kind of political and legal cover it craves.,The argument on Wednesday had some lighter moments, as when Mr. Waxman mistakenly addressed Justice Thomas as “Mr. Chief Justice.”,“Thank you for the promotion,” Justice Thomas said.,The chief justice responded that the job was taken. “There’s no opening, Mr. Waxman,” he said.,Alan Blinder, contributed reporting."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/basketball/nba-trades.html,N.B.A. Trade Deadline Fallout: Uncertainty for the Lakers and Raptors,"All the trades have been made. This season’s roster shuffling, barring a free-agent signing or three coming soon, is complete.,It’s time, then, to take a tour around the league for some post-trade deadline fallout, rumbles, analysis and storytelling:,One of the Lakers’ prime off-season acquisitions, Schröder featured in trade talks with the Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry. The discussions broke down over the Lakers’ unwillingness to include the blossoming Talen Horton-Tucker in a deal for Lowry, 35, who will become a free agent at season’s end.,Schröder, 27, was available because of the gulf between player and team in contract extension talks. He has rebuffed extension offers from the Lakers in the range of $80 million over four years, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Schröder’s efficiency has slumped since his productive 2019-20 season in Oklahoma City, but he is said to be seeking more robust compensation in free agency this off-season. His previous biggest deal was a four-year, $70 million contract extension signed with Atlanta in October 2016.,More surprising than Schröder’s availability was the Lakers’ willingness to package him with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope after Caldwell-Pope was such a key contributor to last season’s championship — and when Caldwell-Pope, like Anthony Davis and LeBron James, is represented by the influential agent Rich Paul.,Masai Ujiri, Toronto’s president of basketball operations, is also in the final year of his contract. There were strong rumbles last summer that Ujiri, General Manager Bobby Webster and Coach Nick Nurse were all poised to receive new five-year deals from the Raptors. Nurse and Webster have since signed long-term contracts, but Ujiri has repeatedly deflected questions about his future.,Like Lowry, Ujiri has been regarded by fans and the organization as Raptors royalty since the team’s championship run in 2018-19. It is widely presumed in league circles that only an overwhelming offer in a highly desirable market could lure him away from the influence and affection he has amassed in Toronto. Yet these many months without a deal and Webster’s rising profile as a natural successor have raised the question: How much longer will Ujiri be running the Raptors?,For a Canadian public edgy about the prospect of Lowry and Ujiri potentially hitting free agency at the same time, this counter question should provide some measure of comfort: Where would Ujiri go?,He was known to have interest in the Knicks’ job before James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, abruptly decided last spring to abandon the pursuit of Ujiri to instead hire Leon Rose, a prominent former player agent. A worthy post-Toronto landing spot is difficult to pinpoint unless the Washington Wizards, who vehemently denied being interested after the Raptors’ championship, amend that stance.,Some around the league, though, have wondered about a potential down-the-road option that does not yet exist. The group heading expansion efforts in Seattle features the longtime sports executive Tim Leiweke, who brought Ujiri to Toronto for the 2013-14 season.,The recent bargain signings of Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge, after the January acquisition of James Harden, have further entrenched the Nets as villains. Coach Steve Nash leaned in to the criticism with some humor when he spoke to reporters on Monday, letting out ,.,“It’s kind of funny to me, because for the last couple years, all I’ve heard is how bad I am,” Griffin said. “You sign with this team and everybody’s like, ‘That’s not fair.’”,The volume on complaints surely would have been higher had the Nets been successful in their attempts to trade the injured Spencer Dinwiddie for a wing player. Among the options they explored, I’m told, was sending Dinwiddie to Golden State for Kelly Oubre. Golden State rejected those overtures because it is still desperate to make the playoffs. While numerous Oubre trade scenarios came up, Golden State was not going to trade him for someone who couldn’t help the team in the short term.,“I think a lot of people thought he might be available, but we value him, too, as evidenced by not trading him,” Bob Myers, Golden State’s president of basketball operations, said of Oubre on Friday.,The Bulls, Nuggets and Magic are known (and sometimes criticized) for not pursuing trades as aggressively as fans would like. So you applaud Denver for making the most ambitious move in the West by trading for the Magic’s Aaron Gordon, which not only enhances the Nuggets’ ability to win the conference but also shouldn’t hinder them in the Bradley Beal sweepstakes if (when?) Washington reaches the point of making Beal available.,The Nikola Vucevic trade, furthermore, was bold for both Orlando and Chicago. The Bulls, who had no All-Stars when Chicago hosted last season’s All-Star Game, packaged two future first-round picks and Wendell Carter Jr. to get Vucevic, who played in his second All-Star Game this season — as did a first-timer: Chicago’s Zach LaVine.,The Magic turned heads, too, by initiating a total tear down and trading Vucevic, Gordon and Evan Fournier after they had been pretty convincing in the weeks leading up to the deadline that Vucevic was staying put. With Vucevic, at age 30, in the midst of his most productive season and seemingly getting better offensively, I thought he was the one Magic pillar they were bound to keep to lead younger players like Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz when they return from injury. Several teams were convinced Orlando wouldn’t part with Vucevic unless it received a substantial offer; Chicago duly put more on the table than anticipated.,Trevor Ariza and Andre Drummond, two of the league’s most prized veterans as title contenders fortify their rosters for the playoffs, worked out in the same Miami gym in recent months.,Ariza and Drummond are among the prominent players who have been practicing at The Miami Perimeter with Stanley Remy, who trains Miami’s Jimmy Butler. Ariza made it his base while on leave awaiting a trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder, who dealt him to the Heat on March 17. Drummond trained in the same gym after he and the Cleveland Cavaliers agreed in February to seek a trade. When the Cavaliers couldn’t find a desirable deal, they negotiated a buyout with Drummond, who signed on Sunday with the Lakers.,Other veterans who have been spotted in Remy’s gym include the veteran center Greg Monroe and, in a surprise, Amar’e Stoudemire. As a , for the Nets this season, Stoudemire, 38, works with the team at home. Yet he does not travel with the Nets and has made occasional trips to Miami to see family when the team is on the road. Stoudemire has also been pursuing an M.B.A. through online classes at the University of Miami., — @MoneyDre123 from Twitter, — @MoneyDre123 from Twitter, You sent me multiple tweets in the past few days that hit on two newsy topics, so let’s address both.,Surprising as it was to see Aldridge choose to join the Nets over Miami, it is no surprise that the Nets have made multiple signings. A free-spending title contender will always hold appeal to former All-Stars like Aldridge and Griffin, who not only covet the chance to compete for a championship but are also trying to rebuild their value as they head to free agency in the off-season.,The surprise here is the development of Brown and Claxton. I don’t remember many touting them to both become dependable rotation players so quickly — whether that’s because of faster-than-anticipated development or the natural benefit of the extra space created by offensive threats like Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Or both.,This was the fourth consecutive season in which deadline day delivered a double-digit number of trades, and I expect the trend to continue. I can still vividly remember deadline day in 2000, when Atlanta’s dealing Anthony Johnson to Orlando was the only sad little trade to go down, but this is a different N.B.A.,You have to go back to 2009 for the last deadline day that featured fewer than eight trades. Although that certainly doesn’t mean we’re going to see landscape-changers every year, I will concede that last week’s activity exceeded even optimistic expectations like mine — even with Toronto’s Kyle Lowry staying put., — Johnny Tse (Hong Kong), Last seen in the league playing a minor role off the Lakers’ bench during their championship run last summer, Waiters is another one of the free agents who has been working out at the Miami Perimeter gym discussed in this week’s lead item.,Though that doesn’t mean that Waiters, 29, will get another N.B.A. shot, Brandon Knight has also been working out there and, according to a report from my longtime colleague ,, recently earned an audition with the Milwaukee Bucks.,Among the factors working against Waiters: There are a lot of proven N.B.A. players competing for roster spots. I asked a noted salary-cap guru and transaction tracker, @KeithSmithNBA, to help me compile a list of well-known free agents without regard to position. A partial list from what he came up with: DeMarcus Cousins, Jamal Crawford, Yogi Ferrell, John Henson, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Damian Jones, Mfiondu Kabengele, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Jeremy Lin, Kyle O’Quinn, James Nunnally, Jabari Parker, Andre Roberson, Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith and Isaiah Thomas., — Bruce Klutchko (New York), I love hearing how much you enjoy it, and we are very much on the same page on this, but perhaps that didn’t come through as clearly as I hoped in ,.,Various coaches and players have said that the advent of baseball-style series this season, in which teams play host to the same opponent in consecutive games to reduce travel, has been a factor in lessening home-court advantage in today’s N.B.A. Pinpointing exactly how much is not possible, but there are presumed sleep and rest benefits for players on visiting teams when they get to stay in one city longer. Put it on the list as a factor in the road teams’ favor along with the more inviting arena atmospheres for visiting teams given the reduced crowds (or empty buildings).,We will keep tracking the numbers all season, but I don’t see how anyone can dispute that playing the same opponent twice in a row, especially with a night off in between, results in more favorable conditions for the visiting team.,The worst might be behind the N.B.A. in terms of dealing with the coronavirus — at least during the regular season. If the league can get through two more days, it will have made it through the entire month of March without postponing a single game in accordance with the league’s health and safety protocols. The league postponed , in December, January and February because at least one team could not field the minimum required eight players in uniform because of either positive coronavirus tests or contact tracing.,The Nets and the two Los Angeles teams (Lakers and Clippers) are the only teams to avoid a game postponement according to the league’s health and safety protocols.,Twenty-seven of the league’s 30 teams made at least one trade during the season, including 23 last Thursday on deadline day. The only teams that did not make an in-season deal: Memphis, Minnesota and the Los Angeles Lakers.,The Knicks were the first team to surpass their projected over/under win total, according to ,. The Knicks’ over/under was a league-low 21.5 victories; they entered Tuesday’s play tied with the Charlotte Hornets for fourth in the Eastern Conference at 24-23.,Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge, both represented by Excel Sports, surrendered an estimated $19.1 million in combined salary to become unrestricted free agents and sign veteran minimum contracts to join the Nets. Griffin (who gave back $13.3 million to Detroit) and Aldridge ($5.8 million to San Antonio) have joined DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and Nicolas Claxton in a suddenly crowded Nets frontcourt. With Joe Harris no less a fixture in the Nets’ closing lineup than their big-name stars, five big men are vying for limited minutes."

Should he be? It all depends on who you ask.,On Tuesday night in Montreal, with McDavid’s Edmonton Oilers already trailing the Canadiens by 3-0 in the first period, the star center laid a crushing hit on Montreal’s Jesperi Kotkaniemi.,Breaking out of the Canadiens end, just over the blue line, Kotkaniemi dropped the puck behind him to left wing Paul Byron and peeled off across center ice. McDavid, racing up on Byron to the left, crossed in front and appeared to target Kotkaniemi even though he no longer had the puck.,A split-second before they collided, McDavid drove his elbow into Kotkaniemi’s shoulder, and then connected with his jaw.,Here’s a wide angle view.,Kotkaniemi, a 20-year-old center fell to the ice in a heap, clutching his face.,McDavid was given a two-minute minor penalty for roughing.,And Twitter in Canada, which until that point had predominantly been focused on the coronavirus pandemic’s , and the plucky Toronto Blue Jays’ , this week, turned its attention to a discussion for and against McDavid, complete with calls for suspensions and fines and Zapruder-film , of the hit.,But McDavid, who leads the N.H.L. with 63 points and ranks second in goals with 21, also had his defenders.,McDavid is known for his , and , — his goals often must be watched repeatedly in slow motion to fully appreciate — but he was visibly frustrated early on last night. His mood had perhaps carried over from the previous evening, a 3-2 overtime win against the Toronto Maple Leafs, when at the end of the second period McDavid skated over to an official and , animatedly: “No penalty? None? Every time!”,The Canadiens hadn’t played since March 20 because of the league’s coronavirus protocols, but they were fresh and dominated the Oilers. Kotkaniemi scored 18 seconds into the game. In the second period, McDavid had a goal disallowed after the Oilers were ruled offside. Montreal won, 4-0.,“I didn’t think anything of it; it was just a normal night.” McDavid said in response to a question from a Le Journal de Montreal reporter about having “an emotional night” that included the hit on Kotkaniemi and his disallowed goal.,Some were sympathetic to McDavid, and the plight of highly skilled generational stars like him whose talents can be routinely hampered by grabs, hits and illegal holds that go uncalled by the officials. Hockey has had , for years.,Still, some argued McDavid ,, or suggested that the N.H.L. department of player safety had sometimes failed to apply standards and discipline consistently. Many argued a less-prominent player committing the same hit would have earned harsher in-game discipline and even a suspension.,The N.H.L. has yet to weigh in, but it is expected to address the incident. McDavid is the , at $12.5 million a year, and perhaps its biggest star.,He was suspended in February 2019 for an illegal check to the head of Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy. In that instance, Leddy was attempting to play the puck and McDavid’s shoulder ,.,The department of player safety does not rule a player a repeat offender if 18 months have passed since their last infraction. McDavid’s latest hit falls well outside that window."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-college-sports-laws.html,How Blowing Up College Sports Became a Rallying Cry for Some in Washington,"Ramogi Huma, a former college football player, had been at a Justice Department lectern for eight seconds when he began an excoriation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.,The governing body of college sports was, he declared, “a predatory economic cartel that treats players like university property rather than people.”,Huma had long used similar language as the leader of the National College Players Association, an advocacy group. But his 2019 speech to a roomful of antitrust experts at the Robert F. Kennedy Building signaled a shift in Washington. Less than a decade earlier, Huma recalled, federal law enforcement officials had told him that the capital’s political climate did not support action against the , Now he was being invited to speak on Pennsylvania Avenue.,“More and more people find what the N.C.A.A. is doing is just patently unacceptable in terms of their treatment of athletes,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who played football at Stanford University and has championed a proposal that would ,. The association, he added, was “not realizing the moral view of this has really grown or shifted.”,The N.C.A.A. is embroiled in perhaps the most crucial stretch of its long relationship with Washington, where top government officials have increasingly voiced doubts about the management and restrictions of college sports.,On Wednesday, the 115th anniversary of the N.C.A.A.’s founding under pressure from President Theodore Roosevelt, the Supreme Court will hear the association’s appeal in ,. This summer, around the time the justices could announce their ruling, a Florida law is scheduled to take effect and allow players to profit off their fame, disrupting the uniform rules that have regulated college athletics for generations.,Those potentially seminal developments were brewing before this month’s N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments demonstrated , between the men and women competing in them, prompting new outrage from members of Congress. And, encouraged by Huma, star athletes at both tournaments , to what they condemned as overly restrictive N.C.A.A. rules that have remained in place even as the industry’s financial might swelled.,The confluence of events could ultimately push Washington toward a few outcomes, including national protections for student-athletes or sustained scrutiny on the N.C.A.A. from Capitol Hill and the Justice Department. What lawmakers say is already clear, though, is that the N.C.A.A.’s political standing has eroded in recent years, diminished by protracted internal debates and bipartisan, coast-to-coast pressure for changes that benefit athletes.,N.C.A.A. officials contend that they are still a force in Washington and that they are committed to new rules to allow players more financial opportunities, especially through social media platforms where many athletes command large followings. Change has been slow, however, because of the association’s byzantine design and because the Justice Department, in the waning days of the Trump administration, , about the N.C.A.A.'s plans.,The association’s president, Mark Emmert, acknowledged in an interview this month that there were “significant concerns about some of the dynamics in college sports right now, and that’s neither inappropriate nor unfair.” But he bristled at more than a year’s worth of assessments by current and former lawmakers, regulators and college sports executives that the N.C.A.A. had become less formidable in the capital.,“We’re talking about these issues, working them through, trying to make sure everybody understands the views of the universities that are the members of the association,” said Emmert, who noted that he had spoken with a senator perhaps an hour earlier. “Are there disagreements? Of course. Are we open to the input, thoughts and ideas of members of Congress? Of course.”,The N.C.A.A. has long been a favored target for frustrated fans, incredulous boosters and, from time to time, senators. But only in the last few years has the association also become such a lasting political target, a status it has been especially unable to shake since 2019, when , to allow players to pursue endorsement deals and hire agents. The measure, scheduled to take effect in 2023, passed unanimously and amounted to a direct challenge to the N.C.A.A.’s restrictions on players.,After California’s move, elected officials elsewhere — some motivated by moral outrage, others perhaps by the prospect of losing a prized recruit to a California school, and just about all sensing an issue that defied traditional partisan lines — joined the chorus demanding new rules. Confronted with ,, the N.C.A.A. shifted its focus toward Washington and promised its own changes.,There has been significant reason to seek federal intervention: Different rules from one state to another, N.C.A.A. officials warned, would allow some universities to dangle better benefits toward recruits and give certain schools unfair advantages. But some in college sports also believed that buttoned-up Washington could be something of a safe harbor, especially compared with restive state capitals where the N.C.A.A.’s concerns were being ,.,In Washington, though, some prominent lawmakers were wary after years of delays and mixed signals from college sports leaders. They were hardly ready to shut out the N.C.A.A., many said, but the association would not go unquestioned.,“There’s no question that the N.C.A.A. has a lot of power,” Representative Lori Trahan, Democrat of Massachusetts, who played volleyball at Georgetown University. “I know my office and I have had plenty of communication with them. But what you’re seeing right now is a bipartisan recognition that the current system is broken, it has been for a long time, and it needs to be fixed.”,Lawmakers, she added, feel “like they’ve got a role to play in all of this. Would we have liked the N.C.A.A. to come up with a proposal that met the need and met the inequity? Of course.”,Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, noted that it was “kind of impossible for them to represent the interests of both Auburn and Amherst,” but suggested that the sprawl of the N.C.A.A, which includes about 1,100 colleges and universities, left its message muddled and inconsistent.,“The power of the status quo in this debate is going to flow directly through the schools and conferences, not the N.C.A.A., and I think the N.C.A.A. has made it pretty clear that they are not able to articulate a consensus point of view but that they’re also not terribly interested in policing student safety and student economic rights,” he said.,Although the N.C.A.A. has a lobbying presence in Washington, powerful leagues have increasingly stepped up their efforts to shape policy. Federal records show that the five most influential leagues in college sports — the Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern conferences — combined to spend more than $1.7 million on lobbying in 2020, up from $300,000 in 2019.,Emmert, a former professor of political science, suggested it was a savvy approach, not a measure of the N.C.A.A.’s clout, for leagues to try to lobby officials who might be particularly affectionate toward their brand-name schools. Others in college sports agreed that a conference-driven lobbying strategy could certainly be good politics, but that it also reflected serious concerns about the N.C.A.A.’s influence.,“The N.C.A.A. blue disc is toxic in some quarters in Washington, D.C., but I would suggest that not all of that is fair,” said Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 commissioner, referring to the association’s logo. “The analogy with Congress is spot on: Everybody loves their congressman but hates Congress, and everybody loves their school, but they hate the N.C.A.A.”,With the N.C.A.A. sometimes proving “a problematic brand,” Bowlsby said, “we, obviously, want to have our own representation.”,That notwithstanding, the N.C.A.A. still has powerful allies in Washington. Until recently, Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis R. McDonough and Vivek H. Murthy, the surgeon general, sat on the association’s board. When McDonough left the board last year, Robert M. Gates, who led the Pentagon for parts of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, took his place.,Legislators are careful not to question the personal integrity of N.C.A.A. leaders. But in a twist that many government and sports officials laughingly acknowledge, the United States Congress has wound up complaining about another organization’s sluggishness.,Some lawmakers say that the N.C.A.A.’s current proposal, which would allow students a regulated opportunity to profit off their fame, falls far short of expectations.,“There are a lot of people who were sort of stunned by how little they offered, or were appalled by how little they offered,” Booker said. “And it may have confirmed a lot of skepticism about the institution’s ability to govern itself, to reform itself.”,Although Democratic proposals have drawn most of the attention, especially now that the party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House, Republicans have offered measures that would give student-athletes greater autonomy but impose more limited checks on the N.C.A.A.’s power.,Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, who led , that drew Bowlsby, Emmert and Huma, did not respond to an interview request, nor did Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who introduced a bipartisan proposal during the last Congress and was the only Republican lawmaker to address the N.C.A.A. convention in January.,“The thing that I’m always balancing in my head is, how do we extend student-athlete rights as far as we can without jeopardizing the system over all?” Gonzalez, who played football at Ohio State University, said in that appearance.,A crucial question now is the timing of any federal action. Some legislators, like Booker and Trahan, believe that the emergence of new state laws will encourage Congress to act quickly, perhaps as soon as this summer.,But lawmakers said the White House had shown only limited interest so far, and Murphy predicted the matter would not go before the full Senate before the end of 2021.,“Realistically, this is not on the top 10 list of the House or the Senate right now,” said Murphy, who said he was unbothered by the possibility of varied state laws coming online.,And while the Justice Department sided with the former athletes whose case, N.C.A.A. v. Alston, No. 20-512, will go before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the department is widely seen as unlikely to take additional quick action on college sports in the opening months of a new administration. Even before the transfer of power, the government was not close to bringing an antitrust case against the N.C.A.A., according to two former law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. The department declined to make Richard Powers, the acting assistant attorney general for its antitrust division, available for an interview.,“We were created through a political process,” Donald M. Remy, the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, said. “It has been the case since then that the public trust of college sports has drawn the interest of federal, regional, state and local policymakers.”,On that much, at least, the N.C.A.A. and its critics and skeptics agree."

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/march-madness-final-four-gonzaga.html,Gonzaga Awaits U.C.L.A. in the Final Four After Bruins Stun Michigan,"INDIANAPOLIS — The warm, fuzzy story line of this N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament is Gonzaga’s pursuit of an undefeated season. The Zags, tucked away on the dry, desolate side of the Cascade Range, have long since grown out of their glass slippers — they travel by charter, produce a pipeline of N.B.A. talent and have won more N.C.A.A. tournament games than anyone in the country since 2015.,Still, the spotlight doesn’t always find its way to the boys from Spokane.,Even on the cusp of a landmark run, the Zags found themselves on the undercard Tuesday night, relegated to the opening act for a pair of blue bloods, U.C.L.A. and Michigan.,No matter, Gonzaga quickly carved up what had been a flaming-hot Southern California team, 85-66, to win the West regional final at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Zags (30-0) will advance to play 11th-seeded U.C.L.A., which stunned top-seeded Michigan, 51-49, to become the second team to reach the Final Four while coming out of the First Four as one of the last at-large selections in the 68-team field.,The Bruins got 28 points from Johnny Juzang, and held Michigan without a basket for the final 5 minutes, 22 seconds, including a 3-pointer by Franz Wagner that bounced off the rim at the buzzer.,As it did, the Bruins poured off the bench and onto the floor, celebrating a wild finish to an untidy game that put them in the Final Four for the first time in 13 years and kept alive a chase for a 12th national title.,Standing in the way is the team that supplanted the Bruins, with their rich but long ago history, as the best in the West.,For all of Gonzaga’s success since it burst onto the college basketball scene with a run to the round of 8 in 1999, this is just the second time it has reached the Final Four. The Zags lost in the title game to North Carolina in 2017. They were agonizingly close in 2015 and 2019, losing in a regional final. And another opportunity was lost to the pandemic last season, which the Zags concluded with a 31-2 record and a No. 2 ranking in the final Associated Press Top 25 poll.,Much as Gonzaga Coach Mark Few has tried to keep his players on assignments and responsibilities that come with each game plan — something they have largely adhered to — freshman Jalen Suggs admitted that with two games left, his team has eyes on the possibility of an undefeated season, which has not been accomplished since Indiana in 1976.,“It’s hard not to think about it,” Suggs said. “We try to keep our minds off of it and keep focused on the task at hand.”,On this night, though, it all came so easily — just as it has throughout the tournament.,Gonzaga, which has had one game closer than double digits all season, has cruised past Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton and U.S.C. with no game closer than 16 points.,The Zags were so unencumbered on Tuesday that Drew Timme, the mustachioed, headband-wearing sophomore center from Dallas, seemed to go through his entire catalog of flexes after scoring — showing off a bicep, twirling his finger or shaking his head after tossing in a jump hook over Evan Mobley, suggesting that the Trojans’ lithe 7-foot freshman could not guard him.,For one night, he was not wrong. Mobley is likely to be one of the first players picked in the 2021 N.B.A. draft but he had little success trying to thwart Timme, who plays with patience and a surfeit of post moves.,Timme set the tone for the thumping just moments into the game, when he stripped U.S.C. point guard Tahj Eaddy of the ball at one end and drew a foul from Mobley at the other after pump faking him into the air. He scored 13 of Gonzaga’s first 23 points. In all, Timme finished with 23 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals.,“It set the tone that, hey, we’re going to be aggressive,” Few said of Timme’s steal. “This thing’s going to start with defense.”,The only moment the Zags’ momentum was slowed was a sobering one. Referee Bert Smith collapsed in front of the Gonzaga bench after he had run down the court. He pivoted in the corner and then keeled over, his head hitting the floor with a thud.,Paramedics rushed to attend to Smith, who remained breathing while lying on his back. As Few huddled his players to the side of the court, guard Joel Ayayi and assistant coach Tommy Lloyd peeked over to check on Smith, who was eventually carried off on a stretcher. He was alert and stable and was not taken to a hospital, an N.C.A.A. spokesman said. He was replaced by an alternate referee.,When play resumed — with the score 11-4 in favor of Gonzaga — so did the beat down.,The game had seemed to promise some intrigue: pitting the most proficient scoring team inside the 3-point arc against the team most adept at defending within it.,U.S.C. is one of the tallest teams in the country with the Mobley brothers, Evan and Isaiah, standing 7-foot and 6-foot-10 being flanked by 6-foot-8 Drew Peterson and 6-foot-7 Isaiah White. The Trojans’ zone defense all but forms a picket fence around the basket. But for all their height, the Trojans do not handle the basketball particularly well and Gonzaga repeatedly doubled Evan Mobley and stripped other Trojans of the ball.,Those steals, six in the first half, sent the Zags off and running, leaving U.S.C. Coach Andy Enfield fuming at his players and then the referees, wondering what became of the team that had routed Drake, Kansas and Oregon on its way to a regional final for the first time in 20 years. Gonzaga led 49-30 at halftime.,The second half was spent largely running out the clock, which expired just as fans on the West Coast were sitting down to eat dinner.,The schedule is made largely by the networks that broadcast the games, CBS and TBS. Tuesday’s games were broadcast on the cable network. TBS spokesman Jay Moskowitz declined to explain why the Zags were put in the early game, which began when much of the country — including the entire West Coast — was still at work.,Both games featured a team from the Los Angeles market, but the networks often prefer to put U.C.L.A. in prime slots — as they have in all five games the Bruins have played. And with a No. 1 seed like Michigan, which has a national following, it may have been a predictable decision.,Not that it bothered Few. He said, simply and seemingly without irony, that Gonzaga fans had their priorities in order.,“Trust me, our fans, they’re not at work,” he said. “If you think they’re at work, you don’t know the Zag fans. Everything’s shut down, and everybody was watching.”"

According to BMI, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” — first released by Simon and Garfunkel in 1970, and since then covered by artists including Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley — has had more than five million broadcast performances.,Among the other songs in the collection are “The Boxer,” “Homeward Bound,” “I Am a Rock,” “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,” “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” “Graceland” and “Mrs. Robinson,” which was featured prominently in the 1967 film “The Graduate.”,Financial terms were not announced.

Neil Young sold half of his copyrights to Hipgnosis Songs Fund for a price ,, and Stevie Nicks sold a majority of her rights in a deal that valued her catalog at $100 million.,In a statement, Simon said he was pleased to have Sony as “the custodian of my songs for the coming decades,” and added: “I began my career at Columbia/Sony Records and it feels like a natural extension to be working with the publishing side as well.”,Jon Platt, the chief executive of Sony Music Publishing, called Simon “a masterful, once-in-a-lifetime songwriter whose remarkable body of work has generated an enduring influence on our culture and consciousness.”,The deal is an important one for Sony, whose publishing division — which until recently was known as Sony/ATV — is the biggest in the industry but has had several high-profile defections recently.,Sony administers Dylan’s catalog around the world, and will lose that account once the term of his contract expires in a few years.

(Guston died in 1980.),The timing “is urgent because of the art’s relevance to our cultural context today,” Marc Payot, the president of the gallery, said in an email on Wednesday, though he said the show was not organized in response to the postponement of the Guston retrospective at four major museums last year.,Mr. Payot mentioned the “racial reckoning and widespread calls for social justice” after the deaths of , and , last summer, and how they “echo the context in which Guston made these late works.”,Last year, three museums in the United States and one in Britain had delayed programming a Guston retrospective, the first in more than 15 years, that included images with the painter’s motif of cartoonish Klansmen because organizers determined the images needed to be better contextualized for the current political moment.,Though Guston intended the Klan imagery to criticize racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry, organizers said they worried it could upset viewers and that the works could be “,.”,The touring exhibition was supposed to open on June 7, 2020, at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, before moving to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, then to Tate Modern in London, and finally, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The directors of the museums announced in a joint statement last fall that the retrospective would , — they had , the exhibition until 2024 — and that “additional perspectives and voices” would be needed before the work could be displayed.,Some in the art world called the decision a necessary step back amid the racial justice protests, while , for avoiding challenging works of art.,But the National Gallery had the support of its board of trustees, including Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, a philanthropic giant. He , in September that if museums had not taken a step back to re-examine the exhibition, it would have appeared “tone deaf.”,“What those who criticize this decision do not understand,” Mr. Walker said, “is that in the past few months, the context in the U.S. has fundamentally, profoundly changed on issues of incendiary and toxic racist imagery in art, regardless of the virtue or intention of the artist who created it.”,Mr. Payot said on Wednesday that Hauser & Wirth had planned its exhibition “for quite some time.” The show will focus on Guston’s figurative paintings and will include works that have never been exhibited before. It will also be accompanied by public programs.,Mr. Payot acknowledged the works were challenging. “But as Guston’s daughter, Musa Mayer, has said, ‘These paintings meet the moment we are in today. The danger is not in looking at Philip Guston’s work, but in looking away.’”,The gallery was still making final selections for the show, but Mr. Payot said that it would include the 1969 painting “Blackboard,” which depicts three hooded Klansmen. He called the painting “an astonishing work, heartbreaking in what it says about the way we teach racism to perpetuate it in America.”,“It’s a rarely seen canvas by an artist at the height of his powers,” he said. “And we are honored to be able to show it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/theater/pat-collins-dead.html,"Pat Collins, Tony Award-Winning Lighting Designer, Dies at 88","Pat Collins, a Tony Award-winning lighting designer and a Broadway mainstay whose work was seen for nearly 50 years in plays, musicals and operas, died on March 21 at her home in Branford, Conn. She was 88.,The cause was pancreatic cancer, said,, her partner of 64 years and her only survivor.,Ms. Collins, who won her Tony for Herb Gardner’s ,in 1986, was the lighting designer for more than 30 other Broadway productions, among them “The Threepenny Opera,” “Ain’t Misbehavin’” and “Doubt,” which earned her a Tony nomination.,“Her lighting was like her personality: She was nervy and intelligent but with a sensitive side,” ,a Tony-winning scenic designer and frequent collaborator, said in a phone interview. “She really blossomed in tech rehearsals; she loved to create on the spot.” He added: “She could do conventional lighting, but she also wanted to try everything.”,Ms. Collins brought an autumnal palette to “I’m Not Rappaport,” about two irascible and inseparable octogenarians who meet on a Central Park bench, and the darkness of looming death to a 1989 production in Baltimore of , David Feldshuh’s play about the federal government’s withholding of treatment for syphilis to poor Black men. In a 2002 revival of Lanford Wilson’s “Burn This” at the Union Square Theater, she transformed figures onstage into what ,“ambiguous silhouettes.”,She also worked at regional theaters throughout the United States and with opera companies in New York, San Francisco, Santa Fe, London, Paris and Munich — always , to establish moods, create the illusion of time passing and indicate where the audience’s attention should be on the stage.,“Lighting has everything to do with how you feel and how things affect you,” Ms. Collins told The Post-Star in Glens Falls, N.Y., in 1975. “Almost everyone has had the aesthetic experience of being moved by seeing light filtered through trees in the forest. Multiply that by one thousand and you’d have some idea of the constant subliminal effect lighting has on us.”,a lighting designer who worked with Ms. Collins on two productions at the Alaska Repertory Theater in the 1980s, said of her: “She understood the point of the show and made sure that you saw it. Whether it was portentous events in ‘An Enemy of the People’ or the sheer fun of ‘Ain’t Misbehavin’,’ her light reflected and communicated that.”,Mr. Chybowski recalled the lighting design that Ms. Collins devised for “An Enemy of the People,” Ibsen’s political drama about a scientist who tries to save his town from water pollution but becomes a scapegoat.,“She went into the studio, worked at my drafting table for four hours, drew up the plan and went off to the airport,” he said. “I said, ‘It can’t be that easy,’ but we put on the show, and it was the most beautiful show we did in my five years at the theater.”,Patricia Jane Collins was born on April 3, 1932, in Brooklyn to Jerry and Alta (Hyatt) Collins. Her mother worked in a law firm; her father left the family when Pat was very young.,Ms. Collins attended Pembroke College in Brown University, where she studied Spanish and joined a campus drama group. After graduating, she spent a year at Yale Drama School — where she met Dr. Stuermer — but felt it was a waste of time. She went to work instead as a stage manager at the Joffrey Ballet, and then as an assistant to , a top Broadway lighting designer, at the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn.,Ms. Collins worked as a stage manager, among other jobs, in the 1960s but did not hit her stride until Joseph Papp, the founder and director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, hired her to design the lighting for productions of ,, which earned her a Tony nomination, and at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park in 1977.,“She had fixed somebody else’s show, and he offered her ‘Threepenny,’” said ,, a lighting designer and longtime associate of Ms. Collins’s. “That put her on the map, and she never stopped working after that.”,For all that she worked on Broadway, she spent much of her time away from it, designing lighting at regional theaters, including Ford’s Theater in Washington, Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, Berkeley Repertory Theater in California, the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles and the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn.,For the Hartford Stage Company’s production of Shakespeare’s “Cymbeline,” , wrote admiringly of “the ever-changing light patterns” that Ms. Collins had created with “mirror images and stars and moons and comets.”,Ms. Collins, who began listening to opera on radio at age 9, designed lighting for productions at the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House in London and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. She also conceived the lighting for Lar Lubovitch’s production of “,” at the American Ballet Theater in 1997.,include “The Heidi Chronicles,” “The Sisters Rosenzweig,” “A Moon for the Misbegotten,” “Good People,” “Orphans” and “Execution of Justice,” for which she won a Drama Desk Award in 1986.,Mr. Beatty recalled being in London one year when Ms. Collins had a double bill of work there — Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods” and a performance nearby at the English National Opera.,At “Into the Woods,” he said, “the curtain goes down, the music starts” and the lighting was “bright and simple, like the world’s biggest flashbulb had come on. Whoa, in your face!”,“There was a certain joyfulness to that,” he added. “Then, she was down the street, doing an esoteric opera, challenging that director to think out of the box. It was perfect Pat.”"
