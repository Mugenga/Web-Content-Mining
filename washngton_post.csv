https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/complicated-geography-vaccine-hesitancy/,The complicated geography of vaccine hesitancy,"In nearly every way, the news about the vaccines targeting the coronavirus is good. The vaccines are very effective at significantly reducing the worst effects of a coronavirus infection and, we learned this week, at reducing , of the virus. It took a while for vaccine availability to ramp up, but by now many states have vastly expanded the pool of people for whom inoculations are available. The country has secured (if not yet obtained) , the vaccine supply needed to inoculate every adult American.,So what bad vaccine news is out there? For one: that so many adult Americans still don’t want the shot.,There has been repeated polling on the issue of vaccine hesitancy, linking it, among other things, to ,. Data from the Household Pulse Survey conducted by the Census Bureau in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows , in that regard. Since January, the percentage of Americans saying that they won’t get vaccinated has fallen from 8.6 to 7.8 percent. That includes about 8 percent of White and Hispanic Americans and 9.5 percent of Black Americans.,As you might expect, views of vaccination vary widely by state. In some places, such as Vermont, nearly everyone either indicates a desire to be vaccinated or reports having already received a vaccine dose. In other states, such as North Dakota, hesitancy is far more common. In every state, though, the percentage of people saying either that they got a vaccine dose (and plan to complete the regimen) and those who say they definitely will get the vaccine has increased since January.,In part that’s because some portion of the hesitancy stemmed from concern about the vaccines’ potential effects. In January, about a quarter of those who hadn’t been vaccinated said they would wait to see if the vaccine was safe; by March, only one-fifth did.,But there are other concerns, ones that seem less readily overcome. About 10 percent of those who hadn’t received a dose cited a lack of trust in government as a reason for not getting vaccinated, about the same as the percentage in January.,This is a complicated, novel situation, obviously, and officials have been deliberate in trying to show the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines even as they highlight the utility in mass vaccination. (In short, the United States can either reach broad immunity through vaccines or through infections, and only the latter poses a significant risk of long-term health effects or death.) What’s also clear, though, is that politics continues to drive responses to the vaccines.,We can overlap the census data by state vote in 2020. That allows us to see, for example, that the percentage of people saying they would definitely not get vaccinated dropped in all but 17 states. Of those, 12 states supported Donald Trump in last year’s election. Of the 22 states in which the percentage of residents who say they definitely won’t be vaccinated is at or above 9 percent, all but four voted for Trump.,There are still eight states in which less than 60 percent of residents either have gotten or definitely plan to get vaccinated. Seven of them voted for Trump in 2020. The eighth, Georgia, narrowly preferred Joe Biden.,All of that aside, though, red states have done a better job to date in getting older Americans vaccinated. In 21 states, at least two-thirds of those age 65 and older say they’ve gotten a dose and will complete the regimen. Of those states, 14 backed Trump.,It’s easy to dive deep into this one bit of bad news and miss the very good news about the vaccines. For example, it’s easy to focus on the 8 percent who say they won’t get vaccinated instead of the 80-plus percent nationally who say they have been vaccinated and will or probably will get the shot. That percentage is , the country’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, has said we need to be to reach herd immunity, although these data are only for adults. (On Wednesday, Pfizer , that its vaccine was effective among teenagers, as well.),The country will reach herd immunity at some point. Ideally, it’s through broad distribution of vaccines. But it will otherwise happen as people get infected, fall ill and, in some instances, die.,It’s easy to see why the experts prefer the first option."

Ron DeSantis, who is considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate.,“We are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said Monday. “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.”,Other Republicans have used more inflammatory rhetoric, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) calling the passport idea “Biden’s Mark of the Beast” and some conservative activists comparing it with Nazi policies to identify Jews.,The hyper-charged rhetoric is directed at a nascent initiative between the Biden administration and private companies to develop a standard way for Americans to show they have received a coronavirus vaccination. The idea behind the passports or certificates is that they would be a way to ensure that people could return to normal activities without risking further spread of a virus that has ,.,Unlike some of the recent attacks from conservatives focused on cultural or economic issues that centered on , and , this one focuses directly on the Biden administration and taps into a long-standing warning from the right: that a powerful federal government will try to control the population.,“There’s been this pent-up opposition to lockdowns and mask mandates and so this is building on that,” said David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. “Now there’s this suggestion that if you don’t get a vaccine, you might not be able to do — we’re not quite sure what. I can see how there’s a market for that concern.”,The attacks also focus on an area that’s been a strength for Biden: his handling of the pandemic. Under Biden’s watch, vaccine distribution has significantly ramped up  and, according to federal survey data, reports of vaccine hesitancy are decreasing. Covid-19 deaths have also plummeted from January highs, in part because larger portions of older Americans have been inoculated. But there’s been an uptick in infections in recent days as states have relaxed coronavirus restrictions.,Now the effort by some Republicans to create doubt about a vaccine passport program threatens to define the Biden administration effort while it’s still in the earliest phase, blunting its ability to roll out an idea that could be a popular project and putting the administration on the defensive.,The discussion around a passport has been led by various industries, including airlines, entertainment venues and sports leagues. Biden administration officials have repeatedly said there will be no national mandate.,Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist, said the fierce opposition from many in the party spawned organically and called the news that the White House is working with the business community on vaccine passports or certificates “a trial balloon that went over like a lead balloon.”,“A healthy distrust of government when it comes to health care is nothing new,” said Gorman, who used to work for the National Republican Congressional Committee. “It’s a line of messaging that has been very successful to Republicans going back to Obamacare and the like.”,Paul Matzko, a historian and author of “The Radio Right,” a volume on how the conservative movement grew via talk radio, said a Democrat in the White House typically coincides with conspiracy theories growing on the right.,The current fervor over a vaccine passport feeds into existing conservative narratives that Democratic administrations try to track and control the population.,“This is a very old concern — this idea of globalized elites with a sinister plan for the world who are going to take away American sovereignty,” Matzko said.,“They want us to be seen, we can’t escape them, we have a mark, whether it is a passport, or a chip or a bar code,” Matzko added, explaining the various manifestations of this theory. “It’s kind of outlandish.”,The conservative attacks were launched after the White House took on a more significant role coordinating a private-sector-initiated vaccine passport effort — with administration officials preferring to refer to it as “vaccine verification” — as aides work with dozens of federal agencies to identify what vaccination data is available and how the passports could best be deployed, said five officials with knowledge of the efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private deliberations.,Some federal agencies are actively working to help provide vaccine passports to their staff or people who use their services. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care to millions of military veterans, is “implementing a VA-issued vaccine credential,” , obtained by The Post.,The passport plan builds off work led by the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that in-development passport data systems meet privacy and accessibility standards and are protected against fraud.,A wide range of private-sector and nonprofit organizations, including Microsoft and the World Health Organization, have been pursuing a range of possible systems, with IBM working with the state of New York to pilot one passport.,Biden administration officials have said they’re trying to strike a delicate political balance: help coordinate the ongoing push for vaccine passports without it being perceived as government-driven or as White House overreach.,“From a Federal perspective, vaccines and vaccine credentials are matters of individual choice — there is no mandate for either,” according to internal HHS slides obtained by The Washington Post. But the ubiquity of vaccine passports, driven by the private sector, “could become perceived as a Federal mandate even though there is none.”,White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients echoed some of those points Tuesday in a call with governors, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post.,“We’re not going to have any federally mandated, universal vaccine credential, and there will not be a federal database,” Zients said in response to questions by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), promising more information in the coming weeks.,Officials also have been holding calls with business leaders, seeking to gauge their interest in vaccine passports and understand new concerns as the issue has become increasingly politicized.,Asked about the project Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the  administration effort as “focused on guidelines.”,Psaki also noted that there will not be a centralized federal database showing who in the country has received vaccinations and there are no plans for any federal  mandate that all citizens have a vaccination credential.,She declined to provide any timeline about when  federal guidance on the issue might be released.,A growing number of travel and entertainment businesses have said they will require customers to prove they have been vaccinated, but some major businesses have said they remain undecided.,Carnival Corp. spokesman Roger Frizzell said the cruise-line giant was “encouraged” by recent vaccination breakthroughs but closely monitoring the “evolving situation” before imposing vaccine requirements. Carnival’s fleet includes the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess, both of which became epicenters of coronavirus clusters in 2020.,DeSantis has promised an executive order barring Florida from participating in any vaccination credentialing efforts and is urging the state’s legislature to act as well. The governor has become a leading opponent of pandemic restrictions and has often dismissed the advice of public health experts who have criticized his downplaying the importance of masks and other precautions.,Some Republicans are supportive of a passport program.,Longtime GOP pollster Frank Luntz said he’s working with the Bethesda, Md.-based de Beaumont Foundation, a public health organization, to survey voters on their reactions to vaccination passports, identify which messages were resonating and understand whether “passports” is the right term to describe the credentials.,“It’s been politicized in two different directions,” said Luntz, arguing that liberals worry that a passport would widen inequities around who has access to vaccines and that conservatives fear it would limit their freedoms.,Luntz said the growing politicization around the passports also threatened the entire initiative. “Unless the Biden administration tempers both sides down right now, they will find within days it becomes impossible to do. I’ve seen this movie and it doesn’t have a good ending,” he said.,Some Democratic pollsters also acknowledge the issue could have some resonance, depending on how Biden handles the situation.,Republicans do have concerns that Democrats, particularly in coordination with large technology firms, are seeking broad control over the citizenry, said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “This will fit that narrative,” Greenberg said. “But that’s not America as a whole.”,He said it’s unclear where conservatives will wage battles over vaccination requirements, and he noted that schools and employers probably will require proof of vaccination.,“I just think it puts them into an incredibly marginal position,” Greenberg said.,One key to where the party goes on the issue of passports will probably be whether former president Donald Trump weighs in on the issue.,Barry Bennett, a former Trump adviser, said the paranoia is probably overblown, and instead likened the passport idea to the yellow fever vaccination card he shows when traveling to countries in Africa.,“For someone who travels international a great deal, I want to be able to prove in a secure format that I’ve been vaccinated so I can go see my clients,” Bennett said. “If you’re talking about having to show papers to get into 7-Eleven to get a Slurpee, I think that’s paranoia. I think people are talking past each other, which is typical Washington.”,

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was on Fox News on Tuesday night, defending himself against newly public , with a 17-year-old girl, when he seemed to pull his interviewer into the matter.,“You and I went to dinner about two years ago, your wife was there, and I brought a friend of mine, you’ll remember her,” Gaetz told Tucker Carlson, connecting that friend to an , of the lawmaker.,He , had been “threatened” by the FBI and told “she could face trouble” if she didn’t confess to authorities that Gaetz was involved in a “pay-for-play scheme.”,“I don’t remember the woman you are speaking of or the context at all, honestly,” Carlson cut in to say, visibly stunned.,Later on in the show, Carlson — still looking surprised — appeared to distance himself further from Gaetz, saying: “That was one of the weirdest interviews I’ve ever conducted.”,The Justice Department is investigating Gaetz, a noted ally of former president Donald Trump, over his alleged relationship with a teenage girl, ,, in a probe that began while Trump was still in office. Gaetz has separately insisted his family is being extorted, a claim that is being investigated by the FBI.,Neither Gaetz’s office nor a Fox News spokesperson immediately responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post early Wednesday.,The interview on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” capped a stunning few hours of news about the Florida lawmaker, who had been investigated for months in secret by Justice Department officials.,After , about the inquiry on Tuesday afternoon, Gaetz, and said the allegations were false. He also claimed the probe was “rooted” in a $25 million extortion effort against his family.,In a separate story, , that Gaetz, a three-term congressman, has expressed doubts about seeking reelection in 2022 and has even considered the possibility of leaving early for a job at the conservative media outlet Newsmax.,On Tuesday evening, the lawmaker appeared on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” slamming the Times report as an attempt to thwart a separate investigation into his extortion claims. Gaetz insisted there was no 17-year-old and denied any allegations of sex trafficking.,“Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you’re dating who are of legal age is not a crime,” he told Carlson.,Gaetz specifically blamed the extortion attempt on David McGee, a former Justice Department official. McGee ,, saying he had no connection to the agency’s probe into possible sex trafficking by Gaetz.,At one point, in what appeared to be an effort to get Carlson to relate to his circumstances, the lawmaker mentioned that the Fox News host was falsely accused of rape years ago.,“I’m not the only person on screen right now who’s been falsely accused of a terrible sex act,” the lawmaker told Tucker Carlson. “You were accused of something you did not do, so you know what this feels like.”,With a puzzled look on his face, Carlson responded: “You just referred to a mentally ill viewer who accused me of a sex crime 20 years ago. And of course, it was not true. I never met the person.”,It was not immediately clear what allegations Gaetz was referring to, or if they had been previously disclosed. In , for ,, Carlson wrote that he had been falsely accused of felony rape several years before then by an accountant in Indiana, a woman he “had literally never even seen.”,By the end of the segment, Carlson had not wiped a look of shock from his face. The host said that because “there’s always more than you read in the newspaper,” he and his producers had immediately called the Florida lawmaker to appear on the show and “tell us more” about the federal probe.,“As you saw, he did,” Carlson added. “I don’t think that clarified much, but it certainly showed this is a deeply interesting story.”"

Kavanaugh said.,Justice Elena Kagan was unimpressed when Washington lawyer Seth P. Waxman recounted the organization was created more than 100 years ago to “restore integrity and the social value of college athletics” against the threat of turning it into another version of professional sports.,“You can only ride on the history, I think, Mr. Waxman, for so long,” Kagan said, adding “I guess it doesn’t move me all that much that there’s a history to this if what is going on now is that competitors, as to labor, are combining to fix prices.”,Lawyers for the players and the Justice Department drew the distinction that the case was about opening educational benefits, rather than simply compensating athletes for their play.,But that still worried some justices about increasing the role of the judiciary in deciding what protects amateurism and what compromises it.,“It’s like a game of Jenga,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. “You’ve got this nice solid block that protects the sort of product the schools want to provide, and you pull out one log and then another and everything’s fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing … comes crashing down.”,Justice Stephen G. Breyer worried about the court interfering with a system that has brought “joy” to millions of people.,“This is not an ordinary product …  and it’s only partly economic, Breyer said, adding “So I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run.”,Justice Amy Coney Barrett was the justice who repeated concerns about “blowing up” the NCAA.,The case is ,.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/matt-gaetz-allegation-explained/,"The Matt Gaetz allegation, explained","There aren’t many members of Congress whose personal lives are the subject of broad speculation. But for a variety of reasons, Rep. Matt Gaetz’s (R-Fla.) has been for some time.,One is that he’s a young and handsome bachelor, part of a handful of House members whose constant appearances on conservative cable television have earned him national attention. Another is that Gaetz has both intentionally and unintentionally stoked that interest, first with ,, then , and most unusually, the revelation last year that , (who is his son neither biologically nor legally).,So when the New York Times , Tuesday evening that the Justice Department was investigating Gaetz in relation to what he describes as a past relationship, the story quickly blew up. Then things got weird … er.,Let us explain.,“The Justice Department is investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz — a Florida Republican considered a close political ally of former president Donald Trump — over an alleged sexual relationship with an underage girl,” The Washington Post’s Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett ,. That relationship allegedly included paying for the girl to travel, potentially across state lines, adding the complexity of potential federal charges related to sex trafficking, according to the Times. Both the Post and Times stories are constrained for fairly obvious reasons, including the limits of available information and the need to accurately convey the potential risk Gaetz faces.,The investigation apparently spun out of another sex-trafficking probe in Florida. That one focused on a former county official named Joel Greenberg, who was , with a number of federal offenses, including sex trafficking of a minor.,“According to an indictment in the case, Greenberg abused his access to a statewide database, using it to look up the personal information of people with whom he was in 'sugar daddy' relationships, including the minor, and to help produce fake identification documents to 'facilitate his efforts to engage in commercial sex acts,' "" Zapotosky and Barrett report. “He was also accused of seeking to undermine a political opponent by surfacing fabricated evidence of racism and misconduct.”,It's worth noting that questions about Gaetz's relationships have emerged in the past. A , from 2019 documents concerns raised by a former member of Gaetz's staff about a 21-year-old he was then dating and who was apparently posting photos of the two of them on Instagram alongside other photos showing not-conservative-politician-friendly activities.,Gaetz’s initial response to the Times focused on the travel aspect of the allegation, telling the paper that while he only knew that the investigation “has to do with women,” his suspicion was that “someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.” He later told the paper that it was “verifiably false” that he had traveled with a minor.,Over the next few hours, though, his claims got much more complicated. He appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to explain his side of the story.,Here's what he said, in full.,Gaetz later looped Carlson into the allegations.,“You and I went to dinner about two years ago,” Gaetz said. “Your wife was there, and I brought a friend of mine. You’ll remember her. And she was actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn’t cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme, that she could face trouble.”,Carlson said he didn’t remember that dinner. He also asked Gaetz when the congressman first learned of the investigation, without receiving a specific answer.,It's hard to say, given the, shall we say, , of Gaetz's allegation. (Carlson himself described the interaction as “one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted.”) Gaetz apparently , messages and documents supporting his claims with Axios's Jonathan Swan, though Swan didn't offer details on what that material indicated.,During the Fox News interview, Gaetz identified the former official as David McGee. McGee spoke with The Post about the charge, saying that Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, had reached out to him. (The elder Gaetz is a former Florida politician who became rich after selling a hospice company he had co-founded.),“It is completely false. It’s a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he’s under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,” McGee told The Post. He said he had no connection to the case other than being “one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors.”,Yep. Earlier Tuesday, news , that Gaetz was thinking of resigning from the House to take a job in conservative media. Outside of the context that emerged with the reported investigation, ,. Gaetz has been on Fox News an average of 87 minutes a month over the past 12 months; for a low-ranking member of the minority party with an affection for the spotlight to make such a transition wouldn’t be a shock.,With the new revelation, though, that story takes on a different color: Was that rumor floated simply as cover for Gaetz to resign for other reasons? (It’s worth noting that resignations from positions of power can be part of plea agreements.) Once we’re reconsidering Gaetz’s willingness to walk away from Congress, we might reconsider his , to resign from Congress to aid Trump’s impeachment defense. Was the impetus for that attention or, even then, some form of self-preservation?,Why, yes! Gaetz is a prolific user of social media and the kind of social media user who alternately deploys it for jokes or as a cudgel.,So we get jokes like this one from 2019, which age particularly poorly.,More curious was this one, which came after Gaetz himself acknowledges being familiar with the reported investigation.,Then there was his unusual vote on a bill focused on combating sex trafficking during his first year in Congress. The bill passed by a 418-to-1 vote — with Gaetz offering the only “nay.”,“Unless there is an overwhelming, compelling reason that our existing agencies in the federal government can’t handle that problem,” he later ,, “I vote no because voters in Northwest Florida did not send me to Washington to go and create more federal government.”,If Gaetz does resign, there’s no real risk that the GOP would lose his seat. Gaetz has won by at least 30 points in each of his reelection bids, and Trump , by more than 30 points last year.,But Gaetz’s position is shaky. The allegations are of a sort that makes it very difficult for his colleagues to come to his defense. Perhaps they believe his claims that he’s a target of extortion — a sort of countercharge that in the past has , to be untrue. But there’s an obvious political risk to vocally defending someone who might face sex-trafficking charges, so expect his political allies (including the former president) to remain fairly muted.,That’s particularly true, Insider ,, because Gaetz isn’t particularly well-liked by his colleagues. One called him “the meanest person in politics.”,Perhaps Gaetz can turn that to his defense. After all, if no one likes him much, wouldn’t that make it more possible that they might try to extort him?"

She also blamed Republican criticism for her decision to drop her appeal.,“Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,” Hart said.,Miller-Meeks was declared the winner over Hart following a recount in ,with a difference of just six votes out of 400,000 cast. Miller-Meeks is now serving as the district’s representative, but Hart had asked the House to overturn the result. Hart alleges that 22 legally cast ballots were not considered during the initial November canvass and subsequent recount, resulting in the tightest congressional electoral outcome in modern history.,Under the Constitution, the House has the right to determine the outcome of their own member’s elections and losers of a race can file an appeal without having to first sue in state court. The House Administration has been investigating the results of the race in Iowa’s second congressional district at Hart’s request.,In recent weeks, Republicans were quick to accuse Democrats of trying to overturn the results of an election just months after all Democrats voted to impeach former president Donald Trump for his role in Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which they said was inspired by his false claims that his loss to Joe Biden was due to voter fraud. GOP leaders accused Hart of failing to first make an appeal in Iowa state courts and going directly to a Democratically-controlled House to get the results overturned.,House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) stood by Miller-Meeks in her Davenport, Iowa district Wednesday where he continued to accuse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democrats of wanting to overturn the race to expand their slim majority.,“Do the Iowans have a voice in this race,” McCarthy said. “If Nancy Pelosi wants to pull that game — to try to pick and choose who — she’s going against the voice of Iowa’s 2nd District, and I think that’s wrong.”,A person familiar with Hart’s decision, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, said she no longer wanted to put her family through mounting negative and what they described as misleading attacks on her request to have the House overturn the election results.,The Administration Committee had just begun the discovery phase of the investigation before Hart’s announcement. They had received initial briefs from Hart and Miller-Meeks’ lawyers and paused consideration of dismissing Miller-Meek’s request to dismiss the investigation in an effort to garner more evidence. Had the committee gone through the investigation process, they could have made a recommendation to the full House about whether to dismiss the case, hold a new election or seat Hart.,However, many swing-state Democrats were already voicing opposition to voting to overturn an election if that recommendation was made. With tight margins currently in the House, it would have been unlikely that Hart would have successfully had the race results reversed.,“There being no contestant, there is no longer a contest, and the Committee will, accordingly, recommend that the whole House dispose of the contest and adopt a dismissal resolution reported out by the Committee,” Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren said in a statement.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/actually-data-dont-suggest-anything-unusual-about-floridas-excess-death-toll/,"Actually, the data don’t suggest anything unusual about Florida’s excess death toll","For months, critics of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) have suggested that his administration is underreporting the effects of the , pandemic in his state. The high-profile firing of (and subsequent ,) Florida’s top data scientist contributed to such questions. Shortly before the 2020 election — in which DeSantis’s political ally, President Donald Trump, was being judged in part on his pandemic response — the state’s reported death numbers ,.,DeSantis’s habit of leaning into criticism from his political opponents has heightened scrutiny of how the pandemic is unfolding in his state. But, overall, the numbers from Florida , from other places, muddying efforts to cast DeSantis as incompetent or nefarious.,Given all of that, it’s not surprising that , from Yahoo News alleging that the number of deaths reported in the state was undercounted was embraced by the governor’s critics. Former governor (and former Republican) Charlie Crist, who’s exploring a run for his old job, , on Twitter that DeSantis “was likely hiding thousands of positive COVID cases,” linking to the article.,The Yahoo report points to research , in the American Journal of Public Health earlier this month that suggests that the “impact of COVID-19” — the disease caused by the coronavirus — “on mortality is significantly greater than the official COVID-19 data suggest.” That assessment derives from analysis of Florida’s excess-death count, the number of deaths recorded in the state that exceeded recent annual averages. Imagine if Florida had seen 1,000 deaths on average in the first week of January in 2017 through 2020. Then, in 2021, the number of deaths jumped to 1,250. That shift, those excess deaths, would suggest that something unusual happened.,Dropped into a political debate, that conclusion seems to support the argument that Crist makes: DeSantis is hiding the true death toll.,Considered in the broader context of the national pandemic, as it should be, it doesn’t.,There is no real question that the number of deaths from covid-19 recorded in the United States is too low. In an interview last May, the country’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, , in a television interview. For a variety of reasons including the slow rollout of tests for the virus, the count of confirmed deaths is likely smaller than the number of actual deaths, as suggested by excess-death data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,The CDC , excess-death data derived from death certificates. The data are usually a few weeks out of date, given that death certificates take a while to be produced and transmitted to the organization. But even so, one can see how excess deaths over the past year have mirrored the coronavirus pandemic.,Below are graphs showing the recorded excess death counts nationally and in several states as a function of the expected average toll in a given week. You can see the three waves nationally that occurred last spring, over the summer and in the fall and winter. Those waves hit different places at different times, with New York hit hard in the first wave but not the second and the opposite pattern occurring in Florida.,There are some remarkable spikes shown in that data, like the one in South Dakota that preceded (and contributed to) the third national wave. What doesn’t stand out is Florida’s excess death toll, particularly when compared to Georgia, its immediate neighbor to the north.,Of course, that doesn’t tell us anything about the comparison between Florida’s official covid-19 death toll and its excess deaths, just that the excess deaths themselves don’t suggest any strange pattern.,So let’s address the question directly. The CDC data include weekly estimates of excess deaths within an estimated range that we can use to show a broad estimate of the number of excess deaths in a region over time. When compared to the official death toll compiled by The Washington Post, you can see that nationally and in New York and Florida, the number of excess deaths has generally run ahead of the number of confirmed deaths. In recent weeks, the number of confirmed deaths has closed with or caught up to the number of excess deaths — because those excess deaths are compiled on the aforementioned delay.,The gap between confirmed covid-19 deaths and excess deaths is not entirely or necessarily a measure of undetected covid deaths. It could also be other deaths that occurred because of the pandemic, like someone avoiding the emergency room out of concern of catching the virus who then dies of a heart attack. What’s noticeable about that lower graph, though, is that Florida’s confirmed death toll runs a lot closer to the excess toll than does New York’s, perhaps in part because New York’s first surge overlapped with a period when testing wasn’t expansive.,All of this aside, you don’t need to rely upon our analysis of the CDC data to lose confidence in the thesis of the Yahoo report. You can, instead, rely upon the assessment of Moosa Tatar, the lead researcher on the study Yahoo cites.,“The impact of COVID-19 on mortality is significantly greater than the official COVID-19 data suggest,” he , National Review in an interview. “But we need further research to determine specific reasons for this. These deaths may have been directly or indirectly associated with COVID-19.”,Or you can listen to Lauren Rossen, who assesses excess-death data for the CDC.,“Florida doesn’t stand out to me,” she said — to Yahoo News."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/31/bogus-claim-that-democrats-seek-register-illegal-aliens-vote/,The bogus claim that Democrats seek to register ‘illegal aliens’ to vote,"Heritage Action for America, a conservative group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, is , on television ads in Arizona targeted at convincing two Democratic senators — Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly — to vote against an elections bill called S.B. 1.,A virtually similar bill, H.R. 1, has already passed the House of Representatives on ,. The bill, among its provisions, would create uniform national voting standards, overhaul campaign finance laws and outlaw partisan redistricting.,Both senators are co-sponsors of the companion Senate legislation, so the odds are slim that the ad will have an effect. (The ad also looks like it was produced with a minimal budget.) But perhaps it might convince voters that the Democrats are supporting what the ad calls a “partisan power grab.”,A number of statements are made in the ad, but for the purposes of this fact check, we are going on focus on the ad’s claim that the bill is designed to allow undocumented immigrants to vote — a charge that would have particular resonance in a border state.,The ,, commonly known as the “motor voter law,” made it possible for state motor vehicle agencies and social-service agencies to register voters. The proposed law would implement what is known as Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) at motor-vehicle agencies, government agencies and public universities.,Noah Weinrich, press secretary for Heritage Action, cited , issued by the Heritage Foundation concerning H.R.1. The report claimed that the bill’s requirement that states automatically register individuals from state and federal databases, such as state Departments of Motor Vehicles, “would register large numbers of ineligible voters, including aliens.”,Weinrich also cited , by Hans von Spakovsky, a Heritage senior legal fellow, that criticized as “biased” a CNN fact check of former vice president Mike Pence attacking the bill.,“The complex sections of HR 1 on automatic voter registration require numerous state and federal agencies to send information on individuals to state election officials so they can be registered,” Spakovsky wrote. “Many state and federal agencies don’t have citizenship data on the individuals they deal with.” He added that “HR 1 specifically states that no alien can be ‘prosecuted under any federal or state law’ or ‘adversely affected in any civil adjudication concerning immigration status or naturalization’ due to being automatically registered.”,While Heritage makes this sound nefarious, as of February, automatic voter registration has already been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia, so over a third of Americans live in jurisdictions that have either passed or implemented AVR, ,. In this legislative cycle, 39 states have introduced legislation to implement or expand automatic registration.,“AVR makes voter registration ‘opt-out’ instead of ‘opt-in’ — eligible citizens who interact with government agencies are registered to vote or have their existing registration information updated, unless they affirmatively decline. Again, the voter can opt-out; it is not compulsory registration,” a Brennan Center report says. “Second, those agencies transfer voter registration information electronically to election officials instead of using paper registration forms. These common-sense reforms increase registration rates, clean up the voter rolls, and save states money.”,As an example of the potential pitfalls of AVR, Weinrich pointed to , when it implemented an AVR program through the Department of Motor Vehicles, resulting in thousands of erroneous registrations, including at least one involving a noncitizen. It turned out there was a programming flaw that caused the system to mix up records, officials said at the time. The registrations were canceled and any vote-by-mail ballots, if issued, were suspended. The computer glitch was quickly detected, contained and corrected.,Since 2018, ,, California has registered 2.2 million new voters through the DMV and re-registered 4.8 million voters — and more than 7 million Californians have opted out of voter registration.,“It’s remarkable how few of the states that have AVR actually experienced these types of glitches,” said ,, who directs Brennan’s Democracy Program.,In any case, registration of an ineligible voter is already a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison (,). It is also unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate in federal office (,).,Peter Whippy, communications director for the House Administration Committee, pointed to several items in H.R. 1’s , that provide safeguards to ensure ineligible people are not registered to vote. H.R. 1 requires every state to implement an automatic voter registration system, but the bill continually makes it clear that only citizens are eligible to be registered. H.R. 1 also requires eligible voters to affirm that they are U.S. citizens before they are added to the voter rolls.,As for the provision cited by von Spakovsky, Whippy said that is intended to provide “a safe harbor for any immigrants inadvertently being added to the voter rolls due to a similar state error and avoid potential deportation or adverse legal action through no fault of their own.”,Weiser said that in the states that have implemented AVR, it had proved to be more reliable and error-free than relying on people’s own assertions that they are eligible to vote. That’s because agencies often already have information on whether a person is eligible to vote, she said.,In this ad, Heritage Action has taken a somewhat remote possibility that undocumented immigrants would be registered as voters under AVR and turned it into a Democrat desire — that they “want to register illegal aliens.”,First of all, it’s against the law for noncitizens to vote. Second, the proposed law contains numerous safeguards to prevent that from happening — safeguards that would not be in place if Democrats really planned to enlist noncitizens as voters.,Heritage Action can point to only one example when an AVR system inadvertently signed up people not eligible to vote — a computer glitch in 2018 that was quickly discovered and corrected, with the registrations canceled. Since then, no other such problems have emerged in California.,If Heritage had made the case that undocumented immigrants might inadvertently be registered, despite the proposed safeguards, this might have been a Three Pinocchio claim. Errors are always possible with new systems. But claiming, without evidence, that Democrats want to enlist illegal voters tips this claim to Four Pinocchios.,(,)"

He was 84.,The cause was complications from an infection, said his friend Justin Zaremby.,Laconic and soft-spoken, Mr. Hill spent nearly his entire government career working behind the scenes, avoiding photo ops while serving as a speechwriter and aide to secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and ,. He was later a policy consultant to ,, the secretary general of the United Nations, during a tumultuous period in the 1990s that included the breakup of Yugoslavia, genocide in Rwanda and civil war in Somalia.,“Attention isn’t something that’s very interesting to me. It seems to use a lot of time that could be spent on something else,” he told the Hartford Courant ,. “Ronald Reagan had a plaque on his desk which read, ‘There’s no limit to what you accomplish, as long as you don’t care who gets the credit.’ ”,A self-described “Edmund Burke conservative,” Mr. Hill championed what he described as the liberal world order, arguing in recent years that Islamism posed a global threat and that the United States “has to stand for democracy.” In 2008, he served as the chief foreign policy adviser for former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s presidential campaign.,Mr. Hill started out in the Foreign Service, with postings in Europe, East Asia and South Vietnam, where he was a speechwriter for ,. He later advised Bunker on the Panama Canal treaty negotiations and, in 1974, began working for Kissinger as a speechwriter.,“He reviewed almost everything I wrote,” the former secretary of state said in a phone interview. “What made him effective was his thoughtfulness, his unselfishness, his dedication to ideas, his understanding of human beings.” Mr. Hill, he added, possessed an “acute judgment” on issues ranging from the evolution of China to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which he increasingly focused on during the Carter administration.,Mr. Hill served as political counselor for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, director of Arab-Israeli affairs and deputy assistant secretary of state for the Middle East. In 1985, he was named executive aide to Shultz, a post that made him chief of staff to Reagan’s top diplomat during a period that included nuclear-weapons negotiations with the Soviet Union and efforts to , with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.,In part, “his influence lay in his quite extraordinary, relentless note-taking,” said his former student ,, author of “The Man on Whom Nothing Was Lost,” a 2006 biography of Mr. Hill. He produced about 20,000 pages of notes — chronicling everything from a religious ceremony in Fiji to comments that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa, made at dinner — resulting in documents that shaped policy discussions.,“I don’t think there was anyone that Shultz trusted more,” Worthen said.,Mr. Hill’s note-taking drew national attention in the wake of a scandal known as Iran-contra, in which the Reagan administration secretly sold weapons to Iran in an effort to win the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Profits were diverted to fund right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the contras, in violation of congressional restrictions on such aid. Shultz, who died in February, was one of the few senior members of the administration to emerge unscathed.,Mr. Hill’s notes helped guide the Iran-contra special prosecutor, ,, leading to the discovery of additional notes from Defense Secretary ,, who was indicted and later pardoned by President ,. Together, the two officials’ notes constituted “an extraordinary record of administration plotting, agonizing and infighting,” according to a 1993 Washington Post ,.,After Bush took office, Mr. Hill resigned from the Foreign Service and helped Shultz write his 1993 memoir, “Turmoil and Triumph.” Three years later he began teaching full-time at Yale, ranging across traditional disciplinary boundaries while leading seminars on Aristotelian statecraft, political oratory and Tibetan civilization, among other subjects.,He was best known for Studies in Grand Strategy, a year-long course that he created in 2000 with historians John Lewis Gaddis and Paul Kennedy. Loosely modeled after a class at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, the course examined large-scale issues of statecraft and social change while drawing on classic works of history and literature.,“The international world of states and their modern system is a literary realm; it is where the greatest issues of the human condition are played out,” he wrote in a 2010 book, “Grand Strategies,” which examined the development of the modern state with help from works by Homer, Thucydides, Franz Kafka and Salman Rushdie.,Mr. Hill came to embody the Grand Strategy course, which was credited with inspiring similar classes at schools including Duke and the University of Texas. Addressing students by their last name, holding open-door office hours each week, he developed a devoted following among undergraduates, even as liberals on campus joked that his class should be called “Grand Fascism.”,“Charlie’s criticism of the Clinton administration was always that it was a bunch of very, very smart wonks who can’t see the forest for the trees,” Worthen said. Mr. Hill and his colleagues “were reasserting the need to talk about giant ideas and not simply make foreign affairs a matter for the technocrats,” she added. “And then 9/11 happened. I was an undergraduate then, and we were so hungry for someone to explain it to us.”,Morton Charles Hill was born in Bridgeton, N.J., on April 28, 1936. His father was a dentist, his mother a homemaker.,He received a bachelor’s degree from Brown University in 1957 and studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated from law school in 1960 and earned a master’s degree in American studies in 1961, shortly before joining the Foreign Service.,Mr. Hill was later a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative public policy think tank at Stanford University.,His marriage to Martha Mitchell (unrelated to the Watergate-era political figure) ended in divorce, and in 1992 he married Norma Thompson and joined her part-time at Yale, where she was a political science professor.,In addition to his wife, of New Haven, survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Catharine L. Smith of Washington; and two grandchildren. Another daughter from his first marriage, Emily C. Hill Van Lieu, died in 2013.,In an interview, his colleague Gaddis said that Mr. Hill focused on literature even more than his Grand Strategy partners, believing that great books offered “a kind of inner vision of how people’s emotions or minds are working.”,“Yale administrators didn’t know what to do with him, where to put him,” he added. “He existed outside of departmental structures. More significantly, he existed outside of specialties. I would say his specialty was finding linkages between specialties. It’s the opposite of siloing, looking for connections across disciplinary boundaries. And of course, there is almost nobody else around at Yale who does that now.”,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/31/biden-pittsburgh-infrastructure/,"With political future at stake, Biden returns to Pa. to rally voters around economic agenda","Weeks before he won the White House, then-candidate Joe Biden hopped off a train at an Amtrak station in Pittsburgh and , a throng of supporters to “build our country and our economy back better than it was before.”,Now, as president, he’s set to return to the Steel City on Wednesday, this time to rally Pennsylvania voters around a roughly $2 trillion blueprint for bringing that pledge to life.,The rollout of Biden’s , in Pittsburgh marks only his latest overture to Rust Belt battlegrounds that Democrats increasingly see as critical to enacting their economic agenda nationwide. Party leaders have been aggressive about promoting their vision for bigger government, and higher spending, since securing $1,400 checks as part of a , in early March. But they’ve taken that message directly and repeatedly to Pennsylvania, sensing the high stakes in proving to swing-state voters they are able to keep their word.,“Biden doesn’t have any room to stumble here, in the sense that the country needs this so desperately and can’t suffer another promise by more politicians that don’t deliver,” said Tom Conway, president of the United Steelworkers, who will join Biden this week.,Biden’s courtship of Pennsylvania traces back to the 2020 race: He started and ended his campaign in Pittsburgh and visited the state more than any other candidate — 19 times in five months — to sap its coveted electoral votes from President Donald Trump. Biden then returned to the state earlier this month to tout the American Rescue Plan, a , stimulus package,that counts among his first achievements and one of the largest economic rescue measures in history.,With infrastructure, Democrats say another legislative victory will provide a powerful local jolt, delivering jobs and other economic opportunities to steel and manufacturing hubs in Pennsylvania, benefiting its many union workers. Party leaders recognize the package would be a boon to their own prospects, as well, with an open Senate seat — and the fate of the party’s control of the chamber — hanging in the balance in 2022.,“I think what we have to do is not be full of crap,” said state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a former surrogate for Biden on the campaign trail who is now running for U.S. Senate. “We have to actually have deliverables and plans on how we are going to position Pennsylvania and this country not to get back to where we were, but to build back better in the way that the president campaigned on.”,But Democrats face a daunting political challenge in overcoming voters’ lingering apprehension about excess federal spending and the tax increases on rich families and corporations that may be required to finance it. Republicans have seized on the size and scope of Biden’s economic proposals to launch attacks that have resonated with some voters in Pennsylvania, perhaps offering a glimpse of the tough messaging war to come.,In Erie, Pa., Mike Martucci perused the olive and pickle aisle at a supermarket Sunday, clad in an all-black Titleist hat and matching mask. A self-described patriotic conservative, he expressed deep reservations with Democrats’ stimulus law, echoing Republicans who charged that too few of the dollars went toward actual coronavirus relief.,But Martucci, 53, struck a more undecided note on infrastructure, torn between agreeing with Biden about the need for repair and distrusting Democrats and the ideas they have put forward.,“It’s needed badly,” he said. “I get that, to stay competitive as a country.”,The White House declined to comment.,The plan that Biden is expected to unveil Wednesday tracks largely with the proposal he put forward during his campaign, when the “son of Scranton” first traveled to next-door Dunmore, Pa., to debut the first pillar of a five-part agenda that became known as “Build Back Better.”,The , nearly a decade of new federal spending to upgrade the country’s roads and bridges, repave highways and replace water pipes, and invest heavily in new technology to combat climate change and improve Internet access nationwide. It is the first of two proposals from Biden, with the second coming in April, totaling perhaps $4 trillion and targeting broad swaths of the economy.,In doing so, Biden seeks to finance the full effort through raising taxes on high-income families and profitable corporations. His plan largely relies on repealing some of the tax cuts adopted under Trump, in keeping with Democrats’ campaign pledge to unwind the 2017 law while sparing Americans who make under $400,000 from paying higher rates. While Biden has expressed an openness to negotiating these tax increases with Republicans, Democrats have signaled they are ready to move forward in the absence of GOP support.,“We’re currently 13th in the world; no one believes we should be there,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday when asked about the need for an infrastructure package. “And he has a plan to pay for it, which he will propose.”,Entering the legislative battle, Democrats have carried an air of political confidence after securing passage of the $1.9 trillion stimulus. Not one Republican voted in support of the plan in a blow to Biden’s early commitment to bipartisanship, but Democratic leaders insist the relief — and their broader agenda — remains widely popular among voters across the political spectrum.,Their contention is likely to be put to the test in the coming months in states including Pennsylvania, where one of two Senate seats is up for grabs next year with the looming retirement of Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey. Because Democrats possess the smallest possible Senate majority, the election may serve as the ultimate gauge of Biden’s economic agenda — a realization that has sparked an all-out blitz by party lawmakers to sway Rust Belt voters early.,“That’s going to be determined by the work that I and others do to make sure the people know what’s at stake for the country in terms of the economy and what our party has tried to do to help them,” said Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.). “We have to make sure they know not only what is the nature of that help and the scope of it … [but] that there is a basic difference here between the parties.”,Ahead of Biden’s speech, Democrats have sought to position the burst of federal spending as a major coup for Pennsylvania, particularly in the manufacturing, natural gas and steel industries. Democrats also see their proposal as an opportunity to bring about a new generation of economic growth and job creation by investing in sustainable energy manufacturing while tackling more local safety concerns.,“People are very conscious of how many bridges are not up to par in Pennsylvania, and it makes us wonder, ‘Am I the last one over to make it safely?,’ ” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D), whose eastern Pennsylvania district is considered one of the most competitive entering the next election.,Republicans have mobilized in opposition, questioning the scope of the infrastructure overhaul that Democrats seek and their preferred way to pay for it.,“Between the $1.9 trillion that was completely unnecessary and wildly excessive to now another who-knows-how-many-more trillions, it is really a massive, massive expansion of the size and scope of the federal government,” said Toomey, who helped broker the tax law.,Despite the Democrats’ success in 2020, , showed that Pennsylvania voters who were most worried about the economy largely broke in Trump’s direction, offering the GOP a potential avenue for attack.,But the Trump administration long faced broad criticism for not being able to deliver an infrastructure proposal, much less a package, despite many promises to do so. Some state Democrats now contend it is the GOP that faces the greatest political risk if lawmakers in Congress who say they support such spending can’t strike a deal.,“Infrastructure sort of became a running joke,” said Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, one of the Democratic candidates for Senate. “Just because it became a cliche doesn’t make it any less true ... It’s going to be a revolution for the union way of life.”,But the verdict may well rest in the hands of counties like Erie, a politically deadlocked expanse in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania where unemployment remains high — and voters remain torn.,As she browsed the citrus section at Walmart on Sunday, Patricia Steele, a nurse, said she was happy to see the stimulus bill pass and knows it is helping people in Erie pay their rent and bills.,She supports the infrastructure bill, particularly the push to move toward clean energy. But the 59-year-old Democrat said she has little hope that it will do much to change the face of Erie’s economic issues especially if contractors from outside of Pennsylvania ultimately end up doing all the work.,“Our people still aren’t going to get the jobs,” Steele said.,Just beyond the city line, parishioners were chatting at the Grace of Calvary Baptist Church shortly after Sunday service. David Richardson, a 71-year-old who said he votes Republican for president, lamented that it took so long for Congress to authorize stimulus aid — and questioned whether the infrastructure bill would deliver “pork” or the economic benefits that Biden had touted.,If people in Erie did get good jobs out of the spending, though, Richardson said he would be glad to see it — harking back to the federally funded projects that helped the economy rebound after the Great Depression.,“They had to do something to put people to work, to help to pay the bills,” he said. “That kind of stuff is good.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-makes-a-big-gamble-on-infrastructure-spending--and-higher-taxes-on-the-wealthy-to-pay-for-it/2021/03/30/6fc7d928-90da-11eb-9668-89be11273c09_story.html,Biden makes a big gamble on infrastructure spending — and higher taxes on the wealthy to pay for it,"President Biden is preparing to make an enormous political gamble: betting that Americans will support as much as $3 trillion in new tax hikes — mostly on wealthy individuals and corporations — to help pay for a jobs and infrastructure package costing up to $4 trillion over the next decade.,Biden is set to announce , during a visit to Pittsburgh on Wednesday, kicking off a legislative battle that could help decide which party controls both the House and the Senate after the 2022 midterms.,The undertaking will mark the first major test of the Biden administration’s ability to shepherd a traditional legislative spending package through a Congress narrowly held by Democrats — while presenting the administration with an enormous political challenge in persuading lawmakers to pass a package that would represent the largest tax hike in generations.,The legislative push also comes on the heels of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that Biden signed into law earlier this month. The rescue plan — which provides money for vaccines and $1,400 stimulus payments to many Americans — remains popular among a majority of Americans, according to polling. But it could complicate Biden’s appeal to the American people to support another high-dollar package in such short order — especially one that costs even more, will require tax hikes to pay for it and will promise results that are less immediate.,If successful, Biden’s package would mark  the largest spending bill in sheer dollars in the nation’s history. But as a percentage of gross domestic product on a yearly basis, the overall 10-year package is actually much smaller than other major economic packages, including the most recent stimulus package, according to Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.,Biden allies and advisers argue that the infrastructure proposal represents the policies and promises that the president campaigned on and that it will prove popular with the public, if not necessarily Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. They say the lessons they learned from the coronavirus relief package — as well as President Barack Obama’s mixed success in selling his 2009 stimulus bill — is that the real risk is not being sufficiently ambitious.,But they are also prepared for a more complicated legislative process than they faced with the relief bill, with more negotiation and attempted compromise with their Republican counterparts.,White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden’s speech Wednesday will lay out his vision for fixing the nation’s infrastructure challenges, which she characterized as something the entire country should be able to agree on.,“Fundamentally, we don’t believe that making a historic investment in American workers and rebuilding our infrastructure across the country to help us compete with China is controversial,” Psaki said. “And while the president will lay out a plan for paying for it over time, we’re also open to having a discussion about alternatives.”,Republicans, who have so far struggled to effectively undercut Biden’s early moves on the pandemic and vaccines, are hoping the infrastructure package gives them a new attack line against Democrats as they head into the midterms. They are especially optimistic that they can use the expected tax increases  as well as the Democratic priorities in the legislation — such as an expected $400 billion in clean-energy credits and another $400 billion toward care for the elderly and people with disabilities — to paint the Democrats as out of touch and hostage to their liberal base.,Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expected the infrastructure bill to be “a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies.”,Chris Hartline, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Republicans see a political opportunity in the legislation because of its cost and its reach beyond building roads and bridges.,“It’s one thing to do a big spending bill on covid,” Hartline said. “The public’s view on this will be different for a bill this big that is not directly related to covid and, to be honest, a bill that’s not directly related to infrastructure.”,The administration’s plan to pay for the package, including through taxes on high-income individuals and companies, is likely to negatively impact even everyday Americans, Hartline said. “I don’t see how this doesn’t include taxes for small busi­nesses, workers — all the people Joe Biden said he’d never raise taxes on,” he said.,During the campaign, Biden vowed that Americans making less than $400,000 a year would not pay higher taxes, a stance he has reaffirmed since taking office. But the White House has already found itself grappling with the potential land mines in discussing raising taxes, after ,Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had to quickly walk back comments last week he made about a potential mileage tax or higher gas taxes.,White House officials are signaling to allies on Capitol Hill that they want to take a substantively different approach to the legislative process than they did when they jammed through the stimulus package earlier this month. They are, gearing up for more negotiations and potentially significant changes to the bill, and say they will be more open to input and alternative proposals from members of Congress in both parties.,A White House aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the administration’s thinking, said the administration wants Congress to make progress on the legislation before  Memorial Day and will consider breaking the legislation up into more parts if necessary.,Jonathan Alter, the author of “The Defining Moment” — a book about President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first 100 days in office that Biden and some members of his team have read — said the backdrop of crises could help Biden extend his ability to pass bold Democratic prescriptions on a range of issues.,“When there’s a crisis, all this talk about small government and ‘Get the government out of my pocket’ goes away, and people need the government to stay afloat,” Alter said. ,The results, not the process or price tag, is what ultimately matters, he said. When Roosevelt was once asked about the political philosophy behind the Tennessee Valley Authority — an immense public power project that he signed into law — Alter summarized the former president as quipping, “It’s neither fish nor fowl, but it sure does taste good to the people of the Tennessee Valley.”,Republicans, however, are skeptical of the administration’s promises that this legislation will be more collaborative. Several have pointed to the relief package, saying the White House merely feigned interest at bipartisanship before steamrolling Republicans and pushing through their original proposal, largely unchanged.,“There isn’t a Republican in Washington holding his or her breath,” said one Senate Republican aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the process. “Democrats showed us their playbook on their so-called covid-relief package: Take an issue with bipartisan support, stuff it full of trillions of dollars’ worth of unrelated far-left priorities, and then jam it through on a party-line vote. We were paying attention. Regardless of what they call it, that isn’t negotiating. And it isn’t bipartisan.”,Democrats are also seeking to avoid a situation like in 2009, when Republicans pounced on the Obama administration for alleged wasteful spending in the administration’s stimulus package. In one example, Solyndra, a clean-energy company, misled the federal government to obtain millions of dollars in loans and then filed for bankruptcy.,Democrats say the Biden administration will also need to be careful to explain the details of the new package, especially as Americans will not see the immediate effects of the spending as they did when stimulus payments hit their bank accounts. Many Democratic lawmakers in swing districts or purple states say they are willing to support the large price tag — but only if the final package reflects critical infrastructure projects rather than what they view as auxiliary Democratic goals, such as efforts aimed at mitigating climate change.,John Anzalone, Biden’s top pollster on the campaign, said the president’s high approval ratings on the coronavirus relief package should buoy Democrats in their efforts to pass another expansive package, especially one in which Biden will clearly outline how he will pay for much of the spending.,Anzalone also brushed aside criticism from Republicans about the federal debt or raising taxes, saying the party approved freewheeling spending under past Republican administrations and pointed to polling showing that most Americans think the wealthy and corporations should pay more.,“The American people feel they get screwed constantly and they’re the target of taxes, and they believe the wealthy and big corporations should pay their fair share,” Anzalone said.,House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a close Biden ally, said the massive price tag on Biden’s proposal simply reflects the severity of the nation’s crumbling infrastructure and the need for historic investment.,“I don’t know why people think you’re going to get broadband into American homes by clipping coupons from the Sunday papers,” he said. “That’s not going to happen. You’re not going to fix the roads and bridges that we all know need to be fixed in this country by praying about it. You got to spend the money.”,Clyburn said he is confident that Democrats will fall in line behind tax increases on the rich despite early warnings from some moderates. Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell Jr. (N.J.), Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) and Thomas Suozzi (N.Y.), for instance, have said they will oppose any change to the tax code unless Biden lifts a cap implemented by President Donald Trump on the deduction for state and local taxes. Democrats’ slim majority in the House — they can only afford three defections — gives them little wiggle room.,“People are already going to grumble about taxes,” Clyburn said. “They are going to grumble no matter what.”,

Liddy confirmed the death but did not give a cause, saying only that it was unrelated to the ,.,A theatrical personality whose event-filled career included more twists and turns than a fictional potboiler, Mr. Liddy was at various times an FBI agent, jailbird, radio talk-show host, best-selling author, candidate for Congress, actor and promoter of gold investments.,The role for which he is best remembered was in the plot to bug the Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate complex in June 1972.,Mr. Liddy’s combination of can-do ruthlessness, loyalty to Nixon and ends-justify-the-means philosophy made him a natural fit in a White House determined to get even with its political enemies.,At the same time, he was viewed by his superiors as “a little nuts,” in Nixon’s phrase. “I mean, he just isn’t well screwed on, is he?” the president complained to chief of staff , a week after the break-in.,With his intense stare, cannonball head, bristling mustache and machine-gun style of speaking, Mr. Liddy looked like the archetypal bad guys he later depicted in television shows including “Miami Vice.” His friend and fellow Watergate conspirator , described him as “a wired, wisecracking extrovert who seemed as if he might be a candidate for decaffeinated coffee.”,Mr. Liddy often boasted of his transformation “from a puny, fearful boy to a strong, fearless man” through a regime of intense exercise and physical bravado such as eating rats and holding his hand over a candle until the flesh burned.,“The trick is not minding,” he once explained of the pain, echoing a line used by Peter O’Toole in the 1962 movie “Lawrence of Arabia.”,He also developed an early fascination with Nazi Germany, saying that he felt an “electric current” surge through his body when he listened to Adolf Hitler on the radio. To the young Liddy, Hitler embodied the “power of will.”,Although Mr. Liddy frequently boasted of his impeccable tradecraft, he made elementary mistakes that allowed his former FBI colleagues to connect the break-in to the White House and ultimately to a small circle of Nixon aides.,He accepted personal responsibility for the fiasco, declaring that he was “the captain of the ship when she hit the reef.”,“If someone wants to shoot me, just tell me what corner to stand on, and I will be there,” he told presidential counsel John Dean.,Detractors viewed the gun-loving, hippie-hating Liddy as a threat to American democracy and the man responsible for many of the “dirty tricks” of the Nixon administration that led to the resignation of the president on Aug. 9, 1974. Supporters admired his war against “radicals” and “subversives” and his refusal to betray his fellow Watergate conspirators in return for a reduced prison term.,Opinions differ about whether the Watergate scandal would have exploded without Mr. Liddy.,Historian , of the University of Wisconsin described him as a lowly “spear carrier” following the wishes of his commander in chief who will merit no more than a footnote in the history books.,The director of the nonprofit National Security Archive, Tom Blanton, said Mr. Liddy “brought out the worst” in Nixon and his aides, “raising the testosterone level in the White House and ratcheting them up to even more extreme action.”,Desperate to contain the scandal during the run-up to the 1972 election, Nixon’s aides launched a coverup with the personal approval and involvement of the president. Mr. Liddy refused to cooperate with prosecutors and Congress, and was sentenced in March 1973 to a 20-year prison term for conspiracy, burglary and illegal wiretapping. President Jimmy Carter commuted Liddy’s sentence in 1977 and he was released after 52 months behind bars.,By his own account, the Liddy of the Watergate break-in was a product of the culture wars of the 1960s. “The nation was at war not only externally in Vietnam but internally,” he said in his 1980 autobiography “Will,” which sold more than 1 million copies. “I had learned long ago the maxims of Cicero that ‘laws are inoperative in war’ and that ‘the good of the people is the chief law.’ ”,George Gordon Battle Liddy was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 30, 1930, and grew up in Hoboken, N.J. He was named for a prominent lawyer and Tammany Hall leader. His Irish-Italian family raised him as a strict Catholic in parochial schools.,“The nuns introduced me to authority,” he recalled. “First, God. And then: The flag.” The son of a lawyer, he was inspired by the example of his uncle, one of J. Edgar Hoover’s original G-men, who claimed to have been involved in the killing of the gangster John Dillinger.,After graduating from Jesuit-run Fordham University in 1952, Mr. Liddy spent two years in the Army as an artillery officer but was exempted from service in Korea for medical reasons. He returned to Fordham to study law, completed his degree and joined the FBI in 1957.,That same year, he married computer instructor Frances Purcell, whose striking appearance, he wrote in his memoir, reminded him of a “legendary Rhine maiden.”,His wife died in 2010. Survivors include five children and a sister.,Mr. Liddy wrote that he left the FBI in 1962 because he wanted to secure a more comfortable life for his family. According to former FBI officials quoted by journalist and author ,, Mr. Liddy was pushed out because he was a “wild man” and a “super­klutz.”,Leaving the FBI turned out to be a good career move. Mr. Liddy worked several years in patent law with his father’s firm and, in 1965, became an assistant district attorney in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,He became a local conservative folk hero through his involvement in the 1966 arrest of ,, a former Harvard professor conducting un­or­tho­dox drug research.,Narrowly defeated in a GOP congressional primary, he took charge of the Nixon-Agnew campaign in Dutchess County, N.Y., in 1968 and was rewarded with a post as special assistant to the secretary of the treasury.,Mr. Liddy’s efforts at the Treasury Department fighting drug traffickers put him in touch with White House aide ,, who had set up a special investigations unit nicknamed “the Plumbers” to combat leaks after the unauthorized release of the Pentagon Papers by military analyst Daniel Ellsberg.,In September 1971, Mr. Liddy teamed up with Hunt, a former CIA agent, to hire a group of anti-Castro Cubans to burglarize the Beverly Hills, Calif., office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, in the hopes of finding compromising material.,After the Plumbers disbanded, Mr. Liddy was transferred to the Committee to Reelect the President (popularly known as CREEP), to organize intelligence activities against the Democrats.,He proposed a million-dollar sabotage and intelligence plan known as “Gemstone,” which was eventually pared back to a $250,000 scheme that included the bugging of the Democratic headquarters.,He also volunteered to assassinate newspaper columnist Jack Anderson, who he thought was responsible for compromising a top U.S. intelligence source. His superiors vetoed the idea.,Unable to find anyone proficient in bugging, Mr. Liddy recruited the CREEP security chief, ,, whose links to the White House were easily traceable. McCord’s arrest, along with four Cubans, inside the Democratic headquarters shortly after 2 a.m. on June 17, 1972, led to the rapid identification of Mr. Liddy and Hunt.,Mr. Liddy refused to testify before the grand jury investigating Watergate, saying he had not been raised to be “a snitch or a rat.” But his silence failed to prevent the disintegration of the coverup after Nixon’s reelection in November 1972. When McCord began to cooperate with investigators in March 1973, Dean and other Nixon aides concluded that it was every man for himself and negotiated their own immunity deals.,As a federal prisoner, Mr. Liddy relished facing down the wardens and gangs who ruled the penitentiary. In his autobiography, he claimed that he responded to racial epithets from African American prisoners by singing the Nazi “Horst Wessel” anthem that he had learned as a boy, celebrating Aryan superiority.,“I don’t believe there was a man there who understood one word of what I sang,” he wrote. “But they got the message.”,After his release from prison, Mr. Liddy finally broke his silence about his role in Watergate with the publication of “Will,” which was well-received by many of his former antagonists. Washington Post investigative reporter Bob Woodward described the book as the “self-portrait of a zealot,” but he also noted that it contained “an embarrassment of riches” growing out of “his blustery conceit and his freedom from any guilt about what he did. . . . His story rings true,” Woodward wrote in his review.,In an unusual twist, Mr. Liddy teamed up with Leary, his former nemesis, for a series of debates on college campuses. The men were the unlikely co-stars of the 1983 documentary film “Return Engagement,” in which they traded compliments as well as barbs.,Mr. Liddy deplored Leary’s “very dangerous” ideas while praising his “marvelous elfin sense of wit and Irish humor.” Leary depicted Mr. Liddy as “intelligent,” “highly educated” and “deeply idealistic” but attacked him for “turning America into a banana republic.”,“He’s Darth Vader to my Luke Skywalker,” said Leary, who served more than three years for possession of marijuana following the Poughskeepsie drug bust.,Mr. Liddy’s career as a screen villain took off in the early 1980s with the role of the dreaded Capt. William “Mr. Real Estate” Maynard on the NBC police drama “Miami Vice,” which was followed by cameo appearances in other shows. On the old Nashville Network cable channel, he co-starred as a crime boss in the short-lived series “18 Wheels of Justice,” a program that he boasted had “no redeeming social value.”,Success on the lecture circuit led to the “G. Gordon Liddy Show,” a radio talk show that was carried by more than 270 stations across the country and reached an estimated 10 million listeners. He found a wide following for his brand of macho wit.,His standard reply to callers asking how he was doing: “Virile, vigorous and potent.” To those asking for his views on the Second Amendment, he replied: “I believe in gun control. Hold the gun steadily and hit what you aim at.”,In recent years, he hawked the “Stacked and Packed” wall calendar, which he claimed featured “America’s most beautiful women, heavily armed.”,As a felon, Mr. Liddy lost the right to own a gun, but he found an easy way around the law. He told interviewers that he owned no guns, “but Mrs. Liddy owns 27, some of which she keeps on my side of the bed.”,Unlike other Watergate defendants, Mr. Liddy reveled in his celebrity status as the man at the center of a scandal that brought down a president and his reputation for carrying out those dirty tricks. His black Volvo sported the personalized tag H20GATE. He acknowledged that he probably would have ended up as an unsung “Washington political hack moving in and out of power” had it not been for Watergate.,“Things are very, very good for me,” he told the Los Angeles Times in 1991. “I’m very appreciative. I was an accident of history.”,

The final decision on the 2024 nominating schedule is expected to be made in 2022, after Jaime,Harrison,,, seats a rules committee at a national party meeting this fall.,Under a resolution passed last year at,the party’s national convention, the initial review of the nominating process was supposed to be completed by Wednesday, but the party did not act. In a statement,from a spokesperson, the party suggested that more time would “ensure maximum engagement with the public and all stakeholders.”,Larry Cohen, who co-chaired the Unity Reform Commission that helped set the rules for the 2020 cycle and pushed the convention resolution calling for a review, said he wanted to see continued discussion about opening all nomination contests to same-day registration and more public participation, including an absentee-voting process.,Those moves are traditionally controlled by states.,He referenced New York and New Jersey, which limit same-day party registration to vote in primaries.,“It will be late, based on the date and the resolution,” Cohen said of the review. “But it’s much better later and carefully thought out.”,He and others have more recently argued that the 2024 ,nomination plan,has to embody the same principles that Democrats have embraced in general elections, by making voting easier with features such as vote by mail. He has also said he wants to reconsider the nominating calendar and the possibility of consolidating the date early states all vote, an idea sure to be rejected by New Hampshire, where a state law requires that its primary be scheduled a week before any other state’s.,“We take any discussions regarding the presidential nominating process seriously,” New Hampshire Democratic Chairman Raymond Buckley said in a statement. “We will vigilantly monitor any discussions within the DNC and anywhere else.”,Former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has been leading a charge to switch Nevada’s nominating contest from a caucus to a primary and make it the first in the nation, a direct challenge to New Hampshire. The legislature is expected to take up a bill on the issue in the coming months.,That has set up a fight that will probably force President Biden and the DNC to mediate a resolution. During the 2008 elections, the party set out a nominating calendar that allowed New Hampshire and then South Carolina to be the first two primaries, while giving Iowa and Nevada the first two caucus slots. The party punished states that refused to abide by denying them a full slate of delegates at the nominating convention, setting a precedent that enforced order in the 2012 and 2016 elections.,Harrison, the former South Carolina party chair, said this month that he had not yet spoken to Biden about the nominating calendar, and that he ,.,“We all were very cognizant that this is an ‘every-four-year’ approach, that every four years, the DNC, after an election cycle, will evaluate what the schedule will look like,” Harrison told New Hampshire television station WMUR on March 12. “And we’re going to continue the tradition of doing just that.”,Biden, 78, is the oldest U.S. president ever elected. He has said he plans to run for reelection in 2024, though he has acknowledged that it is possible he will not be a candidate again.,“I’m a great respecter of fate,” he said last week during a news conference. “I’ve never been able to plan 4 1/2, 3 1/2 years ahead for certain.”,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-jobs/,Biden’s infrastructure and climate plan emerges as congressional wrangling begins,"The White House on Wednesday is expected to unveil a plan to spend $2.25 trillion on a jobs and infrastructure package that could form a cornerstone of President Biden’s economic agenda, two people familiar with the matter said.,Biden’s plan will include approximately $650 billion to rebuild the country’s infrastructure, such as its roads, bridges, highways and ports, the people said. The plan will also include in the range of $400 billion toward home care for the elderly and the disabled, $300 billion for housing infrastructure and $300 billion to revive U.S. manufacturing. And it will include hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster the nation’s electric grid, enact nationwide high-speed broadband and revamp the nation’s water systems to ensure clean drinking water, among other major investments, the people said.,The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal deliberations, cautioned that White House officials were still making last-minute adjustments to the plan and that details were subject to change. The roughly $2 trillion in new spending is spread out over eight years, according to the blueprint laid out to congressional allies Tuesday afternoon ahead of the unveiling.,White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said the proposal will be paid for in new tax hikes. These hikes will be particularly focused on corporations, , much of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the people familiar with the plan said. The new tax hikes would offset spending in the plan over a 15-year period, according to Senate officials familiar with White House calls to brief Congress on Biden’s plan.,The plan will also include approximately $400 billion in clean-energy credits on top of the $2.25 trillion in new spending.,A White House spokesman declined to comment on the new details that have emerged.,The plan, which Biden will introduce in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, forms one part of the “Build Back Better” agenda that the administration aims to introduce. Psaki has said the administration within weeks will introduce a second legislative package. That second package is expected to include an expansion in health insurance coverage, an extension of the expanded child tax benefit, and paid family and medical leave, among other efforts aimed at families, the officials said.,White House officials have not explained whether they will seek to have both efforts pass at the same time or try to get Congress to approve one first. The combined price tag of the plans could top $4 trillion.,The jockeying around these efforts has already begun, as Biden’s allies push for inclusion of their priorities in the next major legislative effort. Centrist Democrats have said the package should be targeted to win Republican votes, seeking a return to bipartisan policymaking after a contentious and partisan vote over Biden’s,. But liberal lawmakers and some economists are pressing the administration to use Democrats’ narrow majorities in Congress to confront some of the nation’s biggest problems, such as climate change, with solutions they say are necessary to address the scale of the crises.,Senior White House officials briefed Senate leadership as well as Democratic and Republican leaders of relevant committees Tuesday afternoon about the details of the plan, according to multiple Senate officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal planning.,White House officials Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, and chief congressional liaison Louisa Terrell did not lay out a preferred legislative strategy during the briefings with senators, according to those familiar with the calls.,Rather, both Deese and Terrell spoke in broad terms about the president’s infrastructure proposal, emphasizing general principles of the plan rather than drilling down on specific dollar figures, said the people briefed on the calls.,During the calls, Democratic senators such as Patty Murray (Wash.) lobbied administration officials to ensure that provisions such as paid leave and college affordability are addressed in the broader White House plan, although that package won’t come until April.,Congressional aides expect a bruising legislative battle that will prove significantly more difficult than the relatively quick passage of Biden’s relief plan, in which Democrats were held together in part by the need to combat the pandemic. Despite some objections, almost every Democrat in both chambers voted for Biden’s plan.,“I’m getting a little confused about how we’re going to get anything done. It’s only going to get more difficult from here on out,” said Jim Manley, who served as an aide to former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) “There’s not only more divisions over where to go, but there’s a certain sense of spending fatigue setting in on Capitol Hill.”,On Monday, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) unveiled a climate and infrastructure plan that called for $10 trillion in spending over the next decade. Biden’s initial campaign pledge to invest $2 trillion over four years was already inadequate to confronting climate change, and his coming proposal may be even less so, said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who helped craft the Markey-Dingell plan. Pollin said a $3 trillion investment amounted to only about 1.3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.,Climate experts have warned the world faces , if it does not reverse global warming.,“That was itself skirting on the edge of being inadequate relative to the climate goals and infrastructure goals,” Pollin said of Biden’s initial plan.,Leah Stokes, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said in an interview that the amount of money designated for the power sector per reports on Biden’s proposal represents,less than what is,needed to extend renewable energy tax credits and lower consumers’ bills as utilities shift to cleaner energy sources.,“We need more spending on climate change if we want to meet this crisis at the scale that’s necessary,"" Stokes said. “We definitely need more spending on the electricity grid and on rebates for home retrofits for electrification.”,Still, Josh Freed, who runs the climate and energy program at the center-left think tank Third Way, argued in an email that the emerging proposals could still shift the nation’s climate trajectory. He noted that the Energy Department is now spending about $12 billion on energy innovation, so the plan would mark a major boost in that area.,“Our analysis shows that the federal investment could end up being matched by an equal amount of private capital, which would go a long way to getting us to our climate goals,” he said. “This [is] a bold set of investments that does get the grid, homes, and clean energy innovation on track to meet the goal of net-zero by 2050, and it creates a lot of jobs now to put us on the path to a real economic recovery.”,Other challenges to the effort have emerged.,For example, on the campaign trail Biden called for a major investment in home-based care services, aiming to clear massive backlogs in states for disabled and elderly people on Medicaid in need of caretaking assistance. While details on the plan are unclear, some Democrats have called for a much bigger expansion of home care than Biden contemplated as a presidential candidate.,Biden’s team is also eyeing as much as $3 trillion in new tax hikes to pay for the two programs, primarily on wealthy investors, rich people and businesses. Those have already come under heavy criticism from congressional Republicans, who say such hikes will damage U.S. competitiveness and drain the nation of vital economic activity as it struggles to rebound from the pandemic.,Biden’s tax plan is expected to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, end federal subsidies for fossil fuel companies and increase the global minimum tax paid from about 13 percent to 21 percent, as well as other measures aimed at taxing corporations that shelter profits offshore to avoid taxes.,Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this month that Republicans would not support tax increases to pay for infrastructure. “I don’t think there’s going to be any enthusiasm on our side for a tax increase,"" McConnell ,.,However, some Democrats are already saying they will vote against Biden’s package unless it includes tax changes that Republicans also oppose. Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.) said in a statement Tuesday that he will oppose any deal that does not reverse the limitation on state and local tax deductions imposed by Republicans in their 2017 tax law. That threat could be backed up by other lawmakers in high-tax states who have sought to reverse the GOP provision, although tax experts have said such a change would primarily benefit high-earners.,The White House is pressing forward despite the emerging divisions. “After all the jokes about infrastructure weeks, we’re going to have a real serious effort to get both infrastructure spending on roads and bridges and programs like broadband,” said Howard Gleckman, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank. “I think there’s pretty broad bipartisan support is a big infrastructure plan. There is not bipartisan support for paying for it.”"

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/30/trailer-amazon-workers-alabama-just-voted-union-whats-next/,The Trailer: Amazon workers in Alabama just voted on a union. What’s next?,"In this edition: How the Amazon union fight changed politics, new developments in special House races, and why people are talking more about coups.,Little-known fact: Half of the air in Alabama in March is actually pollen. This is The Trailer.,BESSEMER, Ala. — On the last Saturday before the union election at the Amazon fulfillment center, the campaign was already winding down. The tent outside the cavernous warehouse, where a mailbox had been provided for workers coming and going, was empty. Two representatives of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union stood at an intersection, holding signs not far from the police car circling the parking lot. Company signs celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. were planted next to cars, with the words “the dream is alive” slightly larger than Amazon's logo.,“They have a loudspeaker playing rap and R&B music throughout the day,” said Perry Connolly, 58, a worker who voted for the union, speaking of management. “They've got a sign up right now, I guess, for Black History Month. And I hate Black History Month. How are you going to sum up our culture in a month?”,Ballots are being counted in the election, which ended Monday, and results may not be known for days. It's unclear whether a majority of the 5,805 workers , ballots will become the first workers at an American Amazon warehouse to unionize — or if the highest-profile labor battle in years, joined by President Biden and embraced by Democrats, will deliver Southern organizers their highest-profile defeat. The company has urged workers to think about their job security and their paychecks; supporters of the drive have asked them to think not just about better working conditions, but about launching a national movement.,“You may not know it, but what you're doing is historical,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said at a small rally outside the RWDSU's nearby Birmingham union hall on Friday. “All over this country, people are sick and tired of being exploited, sick and tired of not having the dignity that they deserve.”,Democrats, from Biden to the local party in Alabama, threw their weight behind a campaign with incredibly steep challenges. The Bessemer facility, in a small and mostly Black city 20 miles from Birmingham, , for less than a year; Darryl Richardson, a “picker” at the warehouse who spends 10-11 hours per day picking up packages from robots, , the RWDSU about conditions there a few months later. In labor terms, the Bessemer facility was a kind of , where some workers began agitating before there was a plan to deal with the inevitable resistance.,(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.),The New York-based RWDSU had a fairly small presence in Alabama, and less than 10 full-time employees — supplemented by rank-and-file organizers and by other unions led by the AFL-CIO, but still small. Neither the union nor Amazon has revealed their spending on the campaign, but in conversations with workers leaving the plant, many said that they had voted after a company presentation, before getting canvassed by union organizers.,“If they come in and things get better, that's a great thing,” said Ashley Beringer, 32, who had left a food- service job for a $15.25 per hour job at Amazon. An “I VOTED” button, provided after she voted against the union, dangled from her lanyard. “If they don't, time to move on.”,Both Beringer and Connelly are Black, like most of the workers in the warehouse. That was a crucial fact for union organizers. The just-concluded campaign pitched the union drive as an extension of the civil rights movement, a fight for dignity just as vital as the battle to dismantle Jim Crow. The Birmingham chapter of Black Lives Matter threw itself into canvassing; campaigners who arrived to help, such as U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell and anti-poverty campaigner Rev. William Barber, made the linkage explicit.,“Black people have to talk about Black labor and economic injustice,” said Eric Call, the co-founder of the Birmingham BLM chapter. “When you talk about the wealth gap that exists between working-class and rich people, Black people have always been at the bottom. Our involvement is sending a clear message that we're going to be demanding respect.”,The record for that tactic, in recent Southern union drives, is not good. Four years ago, the United Auto Workers tried to organize a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., with far more prep time than the RWDSU got in Bessemer, and with a similar pitch about the dignity of Black workers. The highest-profile peg of the campaign was , styled after voting rights marches of the 1960s, with the slogan “workers rights = civil rights.” Like the Bessemer organizers, they drew in Sanders, grabbing national attention. They lost decisively, with just 37 percent of workers at the plant signing a union card.,But a Nissan plant is not an Amazon fulfillment center. The Bessemer drive came during a wave of bipartisan criticism of Amazon — Democrats focusing on the grueling working conditions, Republicans more typically focusing on the company's “wokeness.” Bezos, the wealthiest man in the world, had grown wealthier during the pandemic, a point critics on the right and left made to demand changes to his business.,“When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida ,, becoming the highest-profile Republican to actually support the union drive. Local Republican leaders had , the UAW when it tried to organize in Mississippi, and before that, battled the UAW's effort to , a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. ,There was no such intervention in Bessemer. Meanwhile, organizers and the supporters who came in to help were bringing fresh media attention to the conditions at Amazon warehouses, describing them in piercing terms. “Killer” Mike Render, a rapper and activist who traveled to Birmingham with Sanders, used his conversations with workers and his speech at a public rally to compare what he'd heard to what his grandmother had told him about sharecropping, the post-slavery industry that kept impoverished Black workers on land they did not own.,“I heard about the exact conditions that she described to me when working on a field in Tuskegee, Alabama,” said Render, who accused Bezos of belong to a “planter class” of exploitative bosses. “Unrelenting heat. The inability,to go use the bathroom in and come back and have a full day's work. All these things that a woman who worked in a sharecropping field told me are being said by workers here today.”,The odds of organizing the Bessemer plant were long; like many campaigners nervous about the outcome, organizers this weekend argued that defeat here wouldn't slow them down. In interviews, local RWDSU President Randy Hadley and Alabama Democratic Party Chair Christopher England said that the campaign had brought rare media attention to the workers, and to conditions in the state. Biden's decision to record a supportive video had helped start more conversations with workers; the union was already , the number of workers at other Amazon warehouses who had contacted them about organizing. Whatever happened in Alabama, they had a heterodox political coalition to work with and media interest in hearing from workers.,“That's what it's going to take to get the labor movement back on track, is to get the communities back involved,” Hadley said.,Biden didn't involve himself in the Bessemer fight beyond his first video; a visit by the first lady to Birmingham on Friday, which might have driven more attention, was scrapped due to bad weather. (Jill Biden was not expected to visit the warehouse itself.) But after the votes are counted, labor is expecting more from the president, with the first evidence of how much the White House can help a union drive if it puts a little skin in the game.,“You know, before the Biden video, I was questioning it a bit,” Connolly said. “You know: Are we being greedy? Are we being too sentimental or what? Then when he stepped in and gave his speech and it was like, okay, so this isn't just us. We do have a legitimate gripe and we need things to be better.”,No “key race alerts” or theme music for this one.,How one state's election system is built for angry elections.,The saga of Big Dan Rodimer.,“,”,Big money and a fight for self-preservation.,Democrats go back to the future.,Wait for a gerrymander or try for a six-year term?,The campaign for , is almost over, with Democrats voting today on their nominee for the Albuquerque-area seat vacated by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland — three days after Republicans nominated state Sen. Mark Moores.,Ballots in the Democrats' all-email election went out this morning, and results will be ,, no later than 9 p.m. in Albuquerque. If no Democrat secures a majority of the vote, the top two candidates will compete again tomorrow. Five of the eight candidates vying for the nomination are Hispanic, two are White, and one, state Rep. Georgene Louis, would be the first Native American to replace a fellow Native American in Congress. There's little separation on the issues between the best-known candidates, which includes Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, who ran for the seat three years ago. ,But in the vote's final hours, Latino groups warned that the seat would be harder to defend without a Latino candidate.,“The district is majority Latino & the GOP nominee is Latino,” , the executive director of the Latino Victory Fund. “We need to ensure the Dem nominee reflects the community. We have some strong Latino candidates running.”,Republicans initially struggled to find a candidate for the seat, which has drifted left over the years — from a 15.7-point victory for Barack Obama in 2012 to a 22.8-point victory last year for his former vice president. Michelle Garcia Holmes, the GOP's,2020 nominee for the seat, passed on a race; so did Mark Ronchetti, the party's 2020 U.S. Senate nominee. Both had run a few points ahead of Trump, while losing the district by double digits.,That left an opening for Moores, who jumped into the race just 13 days before the nominating convention. He prevailed over radio host Eddy Aragon, one of the first candidates in the ring, by touting his ability to quickly put a campaign together, saying he'd already raised $250,000 — as much as Garcia Holmes had raised during her entire 2020 bid. (Both candidates, like Garcia Holmes, are Hispanic.) After the vote, Moores dodged a question about the 2020 presidential certification (New Mexico Republicans had offered an “alternate” slate of electors, rejecting the official results), and told reporters he'd offer voters a check on Democratic-run Washington.,“New Mexico has really suffered a lot because of the Biden administration ban on oil and gas drilling,” Moores ,. “The radical agenda of the defund-the-police effort has really scared a lot of people, so we’re really going to be talking about that.”,As he echoed the Republican pitch for 2020, there was a challenge for Moores and his party: breaking through in the suburbs. The 1st Congressional District covers part of five counties, anchored by heavily Democratic Bernalillo County, which casts more than 90 percent of the vote. Garcia Holmes triumphed in the four more rural counties by a total 2,196 votes; Haaland romped in Bernalillo County by 54,812 votes. Moores won narrowly last year, even as President Donald Trump lost his northeast Albuquerque district, running 11 points ahead of the former president.,Democrats, despite their gains in the district, remain wary of a potential upset. Just months into Barack Obama's presidency, they lost Albuquerque city hall for the first time in decades, as two squabbling Democrats split the vote and Republican Richard J. Berry became mayor. In 1997, the last time a New Mexican was elevated to the Cabinet, Republicans won the neighboring 3rd Congressional District thanks to a strong Green Party campaign that sapped Democratic votes.,There's no such dissension, yet, and no other liberals on the ballot. Libertarians selected activist Chris Manning as their nominee over the weekend, and former commissioner of public lands Aubrey Dunn, a Republican-turned-Libertarian-turned-independent, is competing for the seat, writing on Facebook this week that “political parties suck.” (MMA trainer Greg Jackson , but opted against it.),In,Baton Rouge activist Gary Chambers came close to an upset this month, winning 21.3 percent of the vote in the all-party primary, far higher than his support in public polls. While most coverage of the race had characterized it as a battle between state Sens. Troy Carter and Karen Carter Peterson, Chambers came close to surpassing Carter Peterson and grabbing a spot in the April 24 runoff.,Chambers officially endorsed Carter Peterson on Monday, releasing a short video decrying the organizations “who said that Gary can't win” before explaining why he was taking sides in the runoff.,“For me to sit out of it — what would be the difference between me and all the national organizations who sat out on us, and we came 1500 votes short?” Chambers ,. “She's not perfect, and she's not me, but she is a progressive fighter who will go to D.C. and champion the issues that are important to us.” ,Among those issues: the Green New Deal, which Carter Peterson supports and Carter does not, citing the potential impact of a fast green energy transition on Louisiana workers.,Approve: 72%,(+4 from early March) ,Disapprove: 28% (-4),Approve: 75%,Disapprove: 25%,Approve: 60%,Disapprove: 38%,Approve: 42%,Disapprove: 57%,Approve: 41%,Disapprove: 57%,The Biden presidency has focused intensely on the ,, shrugging off news cycles about nearly every other topic, including the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. That has worked so far, in a period when voters tend to be forgiving of a new president. (Before Donald Trump, presidents typically cruised above 50 percent approval in their first 100 days.) But Republicans have the advantage on the issues they've focused most on, especially immigration. Other Ipsos polling has found the ,of that issue far below voter interest in coronavirus recovery — the border has become a top issue for Republicans, but not for independents and Democrats. That arrangement has kept Biden above water, for now.,Already did: 47% (+18 from early March) ,Yes, I will: 42% (-16) ,No: 9% (-2),Already did: 35% (+16) ,Yes, I will: 35% (-9) ,No: 26%,Already did: 33% (+9) ,Yes, I will: 23% (-9) ,No: 36% (-5),In the past few weeks, as the vaccination schedule has ramped up, some Republican-dominated states have made the product more available more quickly for a simple reason: Republicans are least likely to want it. Marist's tracking has found Biden's approval rating hanging steady above 50 percent, and while “immigration” is his weakest issue, it has emerged so quickly that the pollster didn't even ask about it three weeks ago. The trends on vaccination are clearer: Democrats and liberal independents are racing for shots; Republicans are moving more slowly. The highest level of vaccine skepticism comes, not surprisingly, from Trump voters, 40 percent of whom say they won't choose the vaccine. The political mismatch could shape two political dramas: Republican frustration that Trump is not getting credit for the vaccine rollout, and Republican voter anger at the idea of “vaccine passports” that would restrict what vaccine resisters can do., The campaign finance reform-focused Democratic PAC has joined the air war over H.R. 1, the Democrats' For the People Act, responding to GOP-linked advertising in swing states. Ads like this are going up in Arizona, Georgia, Maine, Alaska, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire and Nevada, a mix of states with Democratic senators who might be less committed to passing the bill by breaking the filibuster and states (chiefly Maine and Alaska) with Republicans who the group believes it can pressure. ,Republican-allied ads have portrayed the bill as a grab for power by Democrats who would allow noncitizens to vote or direct taxpayer money to negative ads. ECU's commercials focus on the bill's “ethics rules” and emphasize “secure” elections. “We need to make sure that they are getting the support and the air cover that they need,” ECU's Tiffany Muller said in an interview, “because we're seeing the Republicans' dark money groups come in and spread misinformation about this bill.”, The former Ohio state treasurer plunged into the 2022 U.S. Senate race in the state as a fighter for Donald Trump, questioning the results of the presidential election. His first paid advertising takes a dramatically softer tone, invoking the Easter holiday to talk about how his Jewish ancestors came to America. “My grandma was saved from the Nazis by a network of courageous Christians who risked their lives to save hers,” Mandel says. “Without their faith, I'm not here today.” ,“, Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson are best known as “Diamond and Silk,” a political comedy and commentary team who make fun of liberals and praise Trump. They , at Trump rallies, , — including one where they prayed over the former president — and were , after their coronavirus conspiracy theories nixed their Fox Nation show. ,They also are curious whether there's a way for the president to be overthrown by the military. In a ,on the conservative channel Real America's Voice, the two media personalities speculated that “from a national security standpoint,” Biden and the rest of Democratic leadership could not remain in power.,“Listen, I wish that the military would step in and take over,” Hardaway said. “Larry, Curley, and Moe need go somewhere, sit down, and allow the military to take over from here.” When host David Brody followed up, Hardaway added that the country's elected leadership might need to “to get to the bottom of what the American people saw in the 2020 elections,” and Richardson chimed in to urge “somebody to come in with some common sense and take over.”,It was just one segment, but it wasn't a unique sentiment. Ten weeks into Biden's presidency, the idea that he lacks legitimacy and might well be replaced keeps bubbling up in the outskirts of conservative media. Their deadlines keep changing, but the theme remains the same.,“Donald Trump will be back in office in August,” MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell , hosted by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, reiterating a theory he shared with Arizona conservatives at a rally this month. “All of the evidence I have, everything that is going to go before the Supreme Court, and the election of 2020 is going bye-bye.”,Both comments were first highlighted by Right Wing Watch, a project of People for the American Way, which notes the most head-turning moments from figures on the right who liberals usually ignore. Neither is realistic. But both “Diamond and Silk” and Lindell were elevated in Republican politics by Trump, and the idea that Biden lacks legitimacy for some reason or another ,., Nick Troiano has been tilting against the two-party system for years, with more disappointments than successes. In 2012, he tried to nominate a moderate presidential candidate on the banner of Americans Elect, a new party that never went anywhere. In 2013, he published a book arguing for a “Centrist Party.” In 2014, he ran for Congress in Pennsylvania as an independent, and lost. ,Since then, through his group Unite America, Troiano has poked around for ways to depolarize politics; his , is getting more states to embrace top-two primaries, pointing out that turnout in at least two states that have them (California and Washington) has been far higher than turnout in states that hold traditional partisan primaries. On Tuesday, Troiano launched a new report on the “primary problem,” arguing that so many districts had been gerrymandered as safely partisan than 83 percent of them were basically decided by a primary.,“I think we'll see more states like Wisconsin where bipartisan legislation was introduced with this concept just last week,” Troiano said in an interview. “A key aspect of this is that we don't need to win this reform every day for it to have a dramatic impact in Congress.”,The momentum for primary changes is inconsistent from state to state. Troiano pointed to Florida, where 57 percent of voters backed a top-two primary measure (all parties compete; the top two head to a general election) in 2020. It wasn't enough to meet the state's 60 percent threshold for passage, but it got more support than any candidate for president had in Florida since the 1980s. At the same time, Louisiana's dominant GOP — they hold every major office except the governor's mansion — is debating , the top-two primary, in part, to make sure conservatives come out on top more frequently. ,That's Troiano's point. Top-two produced Sen. Bill Cassidy, the only Southern Republican who voted to convict Trump in this year's impeachment trial; it is seen as the major reason Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska,Republican who has drawn a challenger since her own conviction vote, is seen to have a clear path to reelection.,“I think what's interesting about Alaska is that primary reform can reward leaders, rather than punish them, for taking politically courageous stands,” Troiano said. “Sen. Murkowski has shown that she's willing to do that. Our hope is that as nonpartisan primaries may be adopted by other states, they will liberate more leaders from the threat of being primaried from the extremes.”,314 Action Fund, a nonprofit organization founded in 2016 to elect scientists to office.,At the moment,,, a campaign to encourage Amy Acton, Ohio's former director of the state Department of Health, to run for U.S. Senate in 2022. The group has conducted polling to test Acton in a Democratic primary, and to argue that she's the most electable Democrat who might make the race. ,The fund claims to be ready for a $5 million campaign, unusually large for a single PAC in a Senate primary, and 10 percent of what the group says it'll invest in 2020. “With no potential candidate having a significant cash advantage to start the race, 314 Action Fund’s $5 million pledge in the primary positions Amy as the clear front-runner,” the group's spokesman John Sweeney explained in its latest poll announcement, which found Acton viewed far more favorably than Rep. Tim Ryan, a fellow northeast Ohio Democrat.,Democrats have gone nearly winless in Ohio since 2014, with even Sen. Sherrod Brown's 2018 victory revealing losses in traditionally Democratic eastern Ohio. Ryan, who has floated multiple statewide runs but never made one, has won his seat by shrinking margins, and was overly optimistic on Biden's chances in the state — but he has captured more national buzz than Acton, in part because his district might be obliterated by a gerrymander."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/30/republican-politics-right-wing-media-continue-fuse/,Republican politics and right-wing media continue to fuse,"In June 2015, Fox News quietly , that it was suspending a relationship that was, by then, in its fourth year. A guest who had appeared on the show each week since 2011 would no longer do so, at least for the foreseeable future.,After all, Donald Trump couldn’t both be a Fox News contributor and a candidate for the presidency.,The relationship between the right’s favorite cable news network and the right’s soon-to-be favorite politician was obviously , than it seemed at the time. Trump had reinvented himself as a TV star with “The Apprentice” and had begun to dip his toes into the political world largely by echoing narratives that were popular in right-wing media: questions about Barack Obama’s birthplace, alarmism over the Ebola virus, the dangers of immigration. The Fox News gig established him firmly in both worlds at once.,When Trump announced his candidacy in mid-2015, he did so by elevating things that most Republican politicians wouldn’t say — but that right-wing media personalities couldn’t stop talking about. The Republican establishment tried to maintain a firewall from the rhetoric of the base, out of concern about the electoral repercussions. Trump ripped the firewall apart, bringing along just enough consumers of that rhetoric to squeak into the White House.,What he showed, more than anything, was the value of echoing conservative media’s rhetoric back to its audience. He coddled Fox News hosts and various radio personalities, rewarding them with access that Republicans had previously been far more wary to extend. His administration plucked staffers from conservative media — , — and Fox hired various staffers to fill corporate or on-air positions. The Trump White House was often indistinguishable from Sean Hannity’s show on Fox both in terms of rhetoric and in terms of visible faces. The two had largely fused.,It’s certainly not the case that Trump was the first president, much less the first Republican, to leverage media for political value. What was different about Trump was that he clearly thought that the media standing was at least as important as his political standing, if not more so. It seemed at times as though he had become president to become more famous, not the opposite.,Last fall, voters in North Carolina elected to the House of Representatives one of the youngest people in history. Madison Cawthorn, who turns 26 this year, parlayed a photogenic mug and compelling (if ,) life story into a seat in the U.S. Congress. He, like other Republican freshmen, embraced Trump’s habit of prioritizing attacks on his political opponents over crafting legislative solutions to problems. In an email to his Republican colleagues obtained by ,, Cawthorn was direct: “I have built my staff around comms rather than legislation.”,His focus on Capitol Hill was messaging, not legislating.,To be fair, there’s not much chance for a freshman legislator from the minority party to really shape policy. But it’s rare for a legislator to explicitly prioritize the spotlight of Congress over its constitutional function.,Cawthorn was also simply being frank where others are more subtle. House Republicans such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) are far better known for their gimmicks and turns of phrase than they are for their policy positions. A review of Gaetz appearances on Fox News since taking office in 2017 , that he’s appeared on the network for about 46 hours over the past three years.,Over the past 12 months, he’s averaged 87 minutes a month. If each appearance were three minutes long, that would be an average of an appearance a day.,We are therefore not surprised by , on Tuesday that Gaetz is thinking about taking the next step in his career: giving up his House seat for one behind the desk at the conservative network Newsmax. Newsmax emerged as the more Trump-loyal cable network in the wake of the 2020 election, given Fox’s crowd-displeasing decision to adhere to the reality of Trump’s loss. Newsmax’s ratings, almost always well below Fox’s, have , of late, but for a guy with such a robustly demonstrated affinity for television cameras, it’s easy to see why the upstart network holds some appeal. (It’s not clear how Fox News would fill Gaetz’s hour and a half of airtime each month.),We should be clear that Gaetz is not in any danger of losing his House seat. He won reelection in 2018 by 34 points and in 2020 by 30. But if you want to build a national following with a hard-right ideology, it’s harder to do so in politics, where one might have to compromise to earn a majority, than in media, where (as the Atlantic’s James Fallows ,) a large minority is good enough. Trump was an outlier, in that his strategy of simply playing to a fervent minority actually worked.,Well, once.,Again, it is not new that elected officials would move from politics to media and back. What seems unusual at the moment is the extent to which one appears to be almost an extension of the other.,Fox News has allowed sitting officials to host its shows, as it did with , and then-Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) ,. While it used to try to prevent its talent from engaging in explicit politicking, Hannity endorsed Trump in 2016 and later helped fundraise for the Republican Party. Jason Chaffetz (who left Congress to work at Fox) will soon , a Republican fundraiser in Texas, as Media Matters reported Tuesday.,The network continues to serve as employer of choice for Team Trump, announcing a hosting gig for former press secretary , on Tuesday and signing Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump as a contributor earlier this month. Lara Trump and Sarah Sanders — another Fox personality/former press secretary — are reportedly exploring runs for political office; what better place for them to bide their time until doing so than on a Fox News set?,When Lara Trump’s role was announced on “Fox & Friends” on Monday, she said that she sort of felt like she had “been an unofficial member of the team for so long.” Certainly a fair sentiment, and one with which her father-in-law could empathize.,If Lara Trump does decide to run for the Senate in North Carolina, it will be interesting to see if Fox even bothers to kick her off the air."

The bite didn’t break the agent’s skin, and there was no bleeding, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive subject.,Major returned to Biden’s home in Delaware for a brief time after the first biting incident, and as his absence was noticed, questions arose about what would become of the German shepherd.,The White House was initially silent on the biting incident but later offered a partial explanation — the equivalent of saying Major was taking time away from official duties to spend time with family.,“With the first lady traveling for three days, Champ and Major went to Delaware to stay with family friends,” LaRosa said then.,A fuller explanation came a short time later, when White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about it at a news briefing and responded with what appeared to be a prepared statement, defusing the darkest theories about the pet’s fate.,“Champ and Major, the president and first lady’s dogs, are members of the family and still getting acclimated and accustomed to their new surroundings and new people,” Psaki ,, reading from her notes.,Major, she added, had been “surprised by an unfamiliar person and reacted in a way that resulted in a minor injury to the individual.”,The Bidens , from the Delaware Humane Society. A photo from the society showed the man who would become 46th president of United States holding a leashed puppy in his hand beneath the humane society’s symbol: a human hand reaching out to an animal’s paw. In another picture, Biden showed Major a picture of himself as a younger pup.,Major was one of a half-dozen puppies brought to the rescue agency after they came into contact with something toxic in their home, according to the society. The puppies’ owners couldn’t afford veterinary care and surrendered the animals to the humane society, which posted about the German shepherd.,Biden said in an , earlier this month that Major was receiving more training after the initial biting incident. He chalked up the episode to the dog trying to protect his family and denied that Major had been “banished” to Delaware.,“You turn a corner, and there’s two people you don’t know at all. And [Major] moves to protect,” said Biden. “But he’s a sweet dog. Eighty-five percent of the people there love him. He just — all he does is lick them and wag his tail. But . . . I realize some people, understandably, are afraid of dogs to begin with.”,Champ, the president and first lady’s other German shepherd, is older and so far has not generated any biting-related headlines."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/microsoft-army-augmented-reality/,Microsoft wins $21 billion Army contract for augmented reality headsets,"The U.S. Army has awarded Microsoft a contract worth up to $21 billion for augmented reality headsets that are supposed to help soldiers map the battlefield, select targets and stay aware of possible threats by overlaying intelligence information directly onto their field of vision.,The Integrated Visual Augmentation System, known as IVAS, is part of a broader set of investments meant to make military intelligence data more useful to deployed soldiers, who must quickly make decisions in far-flung battlefields based on the limited information available to them. Many of these so-called “tactical edge” devices build on recent advancements in cloud computing that were developed in the commercial business world.,A ,published by the Army on Wednesday afternoon explained that the IVAS system would help it “achieve overmatch against current and future adversaries.” A separate , published by Microsoft and attributed to Alex Kipman, an augmented reality technologist, said the IVAS program “delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.”,Microsoft has been working to develop IVAS for years under an increasingly common , called Other Transaction Authority. These types of contracts allow military agencies to develop and test new technology through a collaborative prototyping process.,The contract award issued Wednesday allows the military to rapidly scale up that prototype for mass production without seeking competing offers. Such arrangements are increasingly favored by military agencies looking to develop and field new technology quickly. They also bypass many of the regulations that typically apply to large government purchases and are less vulnerable to bid protests.,The program could ultimately be worth much less than $21 billion, depending on how many of the headsets and related technology the military eventually orders. It is subject to two five-year increments, meaning the Army could cut the program short if it is unhappy with the product.,Even so, the IVAS award opens up a sizable new line of business for the Redmond, Wash.-based computing giant, which is among several large West Coast tech companies looking to expand their business with the military. In 2019, Microsoft ,its rival Amazon to win the $10 billion contract for the Defense Department’s central cloud computing system, known as JEDI. The JEDI award has been tied up in , ever since.,A handful of tech companies are developing augmented reality technology for consumer scenarios, such as gaming. But Microsoft has focused its augmented reality business squarely on selling to other businesses, some of which will pay several thousand dollars apiece for customized versions of Hololens, the company’s workplace-focused headset.,Over the years it has cut smaller deals with customers such as Japan Airlines to use its Hololens to train pilots and Swiss-based Tetra Pak International to help its representatives remotely repair its packaging machines.,The Pentagon contract represents a new chapter for the company.,“It’s the biggest mixed-reality deal out there,” said Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder. While the military headset differs from the Hololens that’s available to other customers, it’s based the same technology, and uses Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computer services. The size of the deal, and the imprimatur of the Pentagon as a customer, could spark business from other customers.,“It’s going to turbocharge interest,” Gownder said."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/georgia-voting-law-companies/,Georgia sports teams and major companies such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines condemn new state voting law,"Some of Georgia’s biggest companies — including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines — and Atlanta sports teams the Falcons and the Hawks came out strongly against the state’s new voting law Wednesday amid growing backlash against the business world for failing to do enough to stop the measure from becoming law.,Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian condemned the legislation as “unacceptable” and contrary to the company’s values.,“Last week, the Georgia legislature passed a sweeping voting reform act that could make it harder for many Georgians, particularly those in our Black and Brown communities, to exercise their right to vote,” Bastian said in a Wednesday memo to employees.,“The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.”,Bastian also said that Delta and other major Atlanta corporations worked with state elected officials from both sides of the aisle to remove some of the “most egregious measures” from an earlier draft of the bill and is working with lawmakers on legislation in the U.S. Congress on legislation that would expand voting rights.,James Quincey, the CEO of Coca-Cola, a Georgia corporate stalwart, said the legislation was “wrong” and “a step backward.” He said on CNBC: “Let me be crystal clear and unequivocal. This legislation is unacceptable. It is a step backward and it does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity.”,The strong statements Wednesday come after Black Voters Matter, a national community-organizing group that advocates on behalf of Black voters, held demonstrations and called on Delta and Coca-Cola as well as four other Georgia-based companies — UPS, Home Depot, Southern Company and Aflac — to speak out more strongly against the law.,“We had been telling them it was a horrible Jim Crow bill for weeks, and they were just ignoring it,” Cliff Albright, the organization’s co-founder and executive director, said. ""‘Now that you’ve seen the light and now that you agree with us that it’s a horrible bill, you can actually call for them to repeal it.”,A letter signed by 72 Black business executives called on companies to fight similar bills propelled by Republican lawmakers in 43 states after Georgia’s law was passed, the New York Times ,.,And two Atlanta sports teams — the Falcons professional football team and the Hawks basketball team — issued statements about the bill within the past day.,“The right to vote is the most fundamental citizen’s right and we at the Hawks view ourselves as a civic asset — not a partisan organization — and remain committed to endorsing steps that promote equality and encourage participation by all who seek to cast a ballot,” the Falcons principal owner Tony Ressler said in a statement Wednesday.,Atlanta Falcons owner and chairman Arthur Blank said “every voice and every vote matters” in a Tuesday ,.,“The right to vote is simply sacred. We should be working to make voting easier, not harder for every eligible citizen,” Blank said in the release. “Our businesses and family foundation will continue to actively support efforts that advance voting access for the citizens of Georgia and across the nation.”,Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hit back at Bastian, saying that the airline executive had worked closely with state officials in drafting the law.,“Today’s statement by Delta CEO Ed Bastian stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists,” the governor said in an emailed statement.,Throughout the legislative process, we spoke directly with Delta representatives numerous times. We worked alongside legislative leadership to expand voting opportunities for Georgians, while also taking steps to further secure the ballot box,” Kemp said Wednesday.,“At no point did Delta share any opposition to expanding early voting, strengthening voter ID measures, increasing the use of secure drop boxes statewide, and making it easier for local election officials to administer elections — which is exactly what this bill does.”,A Delta representative declined to comment on Kemp’s response.,The voting measures was signed into law on March 25 after sailing through both chambers of the state’s legislature. Democrats and voting-rights advocates in Georgia see the bill as an act of voter suppression, under the guise of disproved rumors of voter fraud that initially circulated during the 2020 presidential and continued leading up to the highly watched state senate runoffs in January.,Republican lawmakers from dozens of states have attempted to introduce similar legislation, but the SB 202 measure in Georgia is the first to pass. This comes after former president Donald Trump attacked the integrity of the presidential election results in which he lost to President Biden, and after , in December imploring her to uncover “dishonesty” in absentee ballot signatures after alleging without evidence that thousands of ballots were accepted by local election officials in Georgia with forged signatures.,The bill will expand early voting hours, curtail the use of drop boxes for absentee voters, require additional identification for mail-in voting, criminalize third-party groups passing out food and water to voters standing in line outside polling stations, allow electors to challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of voters and require counties to hold hearings on those challenges within 10 days, block the use of mobile voting vans, and prevents local governments from accepting private sector grants. It would also strip the secretary of state’s voting power as a member of the State Elections Board and give lawmakers the power to start taking over local election boards.,Critics say the bill’s measures would allow for partisan influence on certifying elections or targeting of predominantly Black and Brown voting blocks in heavily Democratic jurisdictions, particularly in Atlanta.,Citi CFO Mark Mason said in a , Wednesday afternoon that he was “appalled” by the bill. Edward Skyler, the company’s head of global public affairs, also addressed voting rights generally in a LinkedIn ,.,“I see it as a disgrace that our country’s efforts to keep Black Americans from engaging fully in our constitutional right to vote continue to this day,” Mason said. “I will join the efforts of many of my fellow Americans in working to ensure other states don’t follow this horrible example. Many heroes have dedicated their lives to fighting for our rights, and we cannot let this type of disenfranchisement go unchallenged.”,Home Depot spokeswoman Sara Gorman pointed to the company’s internal voter education promotion, when asked about SB 202, and said in an email: “We believe that all elections should be accessible, fair and secure and support broad voter participation. We’ll continue to work to ensure our associates, both in Georgia and across the country, have the information and resources to vote.”,Albright said that he would prefer to see Bastian and other corporate leaders testify to legislators that SB 202 will be detrimental to Georgia’s businesses and that their companies don’t support it. He hopes these corporations will rally behind voting-rights advocates’ efforts to push back against similar bills that are up for approval in states like Texas — before they’re passed.,“It’s not enough to just be against voter suppression. You’ve got to be an active advocate for voting rights. Just like it’s not enough to not be racist, you have to be anti-racist,” Albright said. “There’s no balanced approach to human rights.”"

In March 2020, Congress passed legislation that boosted and supplemented regular unemployment benefits, including a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which extended help to workers left out of their state’s systems.,The report by the Government Accountability Office said the Labor Department reported that “states had identified more than $3.6 billion in PUA overpayments from March 2020 through February 2021.” In addition, states identified $2.6 billion in regular unemployment insurance overpayments in the last three quarters of 2020.,The report noted that “overpayments are not necessarily a result of fraud, though some may be.” States generally must require people to repay overpayments, but they can also waive that requirement if they find an individual was “without fault.” For instance, in October the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment , to 9,000 Coloradans after acknowledging that confusing forms for gig workers may have led some people to overestimate their incomes.,The numbers reported by the GAO represent a much higher overpayment amount than was previously known. When the GAO addressed the issue in ,, it found that Labor Department data showed $1.1 billion in PUA overpayments between March and December 2020, and it recommended that the agency collect the data from states.,The GAO’s January report also repeated and elaborated on concerns about fraud in an emergency relief program run by the Small Business Administration (SBA), called the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program, which offers up to $10,000 to businesses and nonprofit organizations. By the end of December, the , 3.6 million low-interest loans worth $197 billion.,The GAO reported that the SBA’s independent auditor stated in December that the agency “was unable to provide adequate documentation to support a significant number of transactions and account balances related to EIDL due to inadequate processes and controls.”,The auditor also found over 6,000 EIDL loans worth more than $212 million “issued to potentially ineligible borrowers,” the GAO found.,Between May 2020 and February, the Justice Department announced charges against more than 50 defendants in more than 30 fraud cases connected with EIDL loans, the GAO said. As of February, at least five people had pleaded guilty to federal charges of defrauding the program.,The SBA told the watchdog that it was working to better document its processes and controls for future audits, and that it agreed with a GAO recommendation that it put in place an oversight plan for the disaster loans."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/takeaways-biden-infrastructure-plan/,5 key takeaways from Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan,"President Biden is kicking off the campaign to get his second big initiative — a , — enacted by the summer.,Upgrading the nation’s infrastructure was on President Donald Trump’s wish list, but he wasn’t able to get it done. Biden is eager to show that he can deliver where the last president failed. Fixing the nation’s infrastructure has widespread support across the political spectrum because it creates jobs and tangibly improves nearly every community in the nation. The logjam in Congress has always been how to pay for the upgrades: raise taxes and tolls, cut other programs or take on more debt?,Biden is opting mainly for the tax hike option. He is proposing tax hikes on corporations. There’s already pushback from business leaders who claim this will hurt U.S. competitiveness. And there’s a vocal chorus questioning the White House math that says eight years of infrastructure spending would be paid for by 15 years of higher taxes on businesses.,As Biden makes his opening pitch for his infrastructure plan, here are the key takeaways.,The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the U.S. a , for infrastructure, noting that nearly 4 out of every 10 bridges are more than a half-century old and that a water main ruptures every two minutes. In most communities across the nation, people can quickly point to roads, bridges, pipes, ports and airports that look dated — and dangerous.,And then there’s the lack of reliable Internet in parts of the nation. The consequences of not having adequate high-speed Internet have been on display during the pandemic, as low-income students , because they didn’t have sufficient Internet access to attend online classes.,The White House is pitching this as a jobs plan and a way for the United States to keep up with other nations that are investing heavily in all different types of infrastructure, especially China.,About half of Biden’s plan goes toward traditional infrastructure. He calls for about $620 billion for roads, ports and bridges, including about $100 billion to bring high-speed Internet to all Americans. There’s another $111 billion to replace antiquated lead pipes and make drinking water safer, and $100 billion for retraining so workers can get higher-skilled jobs.,The other half of the bill makes investments to reduce climate change and modernize schools, manufacturing hubs and eldercare facilities. The White House argues these should also be viewed as critical infrastructure, but others see them as partisan Democratic priorities. This second $1 trillion in spending is where much of the debate is going to center. Biden will have to chose, as he did on the stimulus package, whether to take some of this other spending out to try to win GOP votes, or to stick to his plan and pass the bill with only Democratic votes.,For example, the proposal calls for $400 billion for housing for the elderly and disabled, more than $200 billion to upgrade public housing, low-income homes and $100 billion to retrofit schools. There’s also $300 billion to revive U.S. manufacturing, including a big investment in clean energy and climate change research and $50 billion for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Biden also wants to include the Protecting the Right to Organize Act that would make it ,.,To fund his more than $2 trillion plan, Biden is asking companies to pay up. Trump enacted the largest corporate tax rate cut in U.S. history, slashing the business tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Biden wants to increase it to 28 percent. The plan also calls for ensuring companies pay at least some taxes by imposing a 15 percent minimum tax on income and by taxing some foreign income of large global corporations to discourage them from moving operations overseas to tax havens.,Classic economic theory says that a tax increase will have some negative effects such as less investment or hiring. But many Democratic economists say the positives far outweigh the negatives and that companies can handle this new level of taxation. They point out this is a major investment that will make business easier in the United States.,But business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are already pushing back, saying this could make it harder for U.S. companies to compete with foreign ones that have lower tax rates. They say these major upgrades should be paid for by a wider group of the people who use them, such as by tolls on roads or raising the gas tax.,The White House is already getting criticized for portraying this as a plan that is “paid for” by tax increases, when the numbers don’t actually add up.,The proposal calls for about $2.3 trillion in spending over eight years, yet it would take 15 years for the proposed tax increases to generate that amount of money. That’s not how budgeting normally works.,“Put another way, roughly half of the spending will be paid for,” , Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.,The standard way to look at spending like this is to add up how much it costs over a decade and how much of that cost is paid for over the same 10-year window. The proposed tax hikes generate only about $1.5 trillion over a decade, meaning this plan would add close to $1 trillion to the U.S. debt.,The United States still has nearly 10 million people out of work — more than the worst days of the Great Recession. While many economists predict a boom this summer as most Americans get vaccinated and start traveling and dining again, there are still likely to be ,. This infrastructure bill is widely expected to create a lot of good-paying jobs. The typical wage for a construction job is close to $30 an hour, according to the Labor Department, which is significantly higher than the median pay of,for all U.S. jobs.,Biden is haunted by the “jobless recovery” that occurred after the Great Recession, when it took nearly a decade to get everyone back to work. It’s why he wanted the large covid-19 relief package that passed earlier in March. This infrastructure package is another effort to ensure jobs do return quickly.,While much of the money from Biden’s $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief bill is likely to be spent in the next six months, this first-round $2 trillion infrastructure package would pump money into the economy for years to come, helping provide an extra boost to jobs and the economy throughout Biden’s first term."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/biden-drug-prices-trump/,Trump gave drug companies a last-minute win on prescription prices. Democrats want Biden to roll it back.,"Two weeks before President Donald Trump left office, his administration bestowed a parting gift on the U.S. prescription drug industry. It ,to block the government from citing exorbitant prices to seize control of a drug’s production.,The rule, drawn up by a division of the Commerce Department, would settle , over when government is justified in exercising “march in” rights over taxpayer-supported government inventions. The 40-year-old Bayh-Dole law gives the government power to grant a license to another manufacturer if a company is not making a government-sponsored invention available to the public on “reasonable terms.”,The government has never used the extraordinary power, regardless of which party has held the White House. But it has remained a battleground in Washington debates over the high prices of prescription drugs.,Under industry pressure and to the dismay of patient advocates, the Trump administration on Jan. 4 set in motion a plan to end the debate. Its proposed rule, which could become final in as little as a few months, would narrow the circumstances under which march-in rights could be deployed. The definition of “reasonable terms” would never apply to the price of a drug, no matter how high, under the Trump rule.,Democrats in Congress and health advocates say the proposed rule would eliminate one of the few impediments to sky-high drug prices in the United States. The nonprofit groups Knowledge Ecology International and Public Citizen, as well as several activist organizations with big email lists of grass-roots supporters, are demanding that President Biden’s administration reverse the Trump move.,The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, has not yet submitted a comment on the proposed rule. The comment period closes April 5. In 2019, urging the Commerce Department to take this step, it said the move is needed to clarify the intent of the 1980 law.,Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will have to decide whether to overturn the Trump action or make it final. Groups against the rule have used the official comment period to organize submissions of thousands of cookie-cutter messages from individual citizens denouncing the proposed restriction and calling on Raimondo to reverse the plan.,The Commerce Department declined to say how Raimondo views the issue.,Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra has forcefully supported march-in rights. Last year — as California attorney general, and as the coronavirus raged in his state — Becerra called on the government to seize production rights for ,, the first authorized treatment for covid-19, citing high prices and limited production.,That position put Becerra at odds with the leader of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, who has said NIH lawyers have advised him that the price of a drug cannot be used as a justification for a march-in action.,In 2016, Becerra, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, also signed a letter by 50 congressional Democrats urging Collins to set up guidelines for when price could be used to justify marching in.,The Department of Health and Human Services, which will have an opportunity to provide input on the final rule, declined to comment.,Topher Spiro, associate director of health at the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews rules proposed by government agencies before they are finalized, has also argued previously for the use of march-in rights to incentivize lower drug prices, as lead author of a ,, where he was vice president for health policy. Asked whether Spiro would play a role in the review, the OMB did not respond.,Liberal Democrats in Congress are pushing the Biden administration to reject the Trump rule.,“It concerns me greatly that the Biden administration has not questioned this approach already,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.), the organizer of a letter this week signed by House and Senate Democrats denouncing the Commerce Department proposal and urging that it be scrapped. “We have so few tools to combat prescription price gouging. Why remove one of the only ones we have?”,In their letter, the three dozen lawmakers pointed out that the invention of drugs often relies heavily on government.,“As the angel investors underwriting the risk of development, taxpayers deserve access to these products on reasonable terms, including fair pricing that accounts for the investment made,” said the letter, signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), among others.,The Bayh-Dole law dictates how technologies supported by NIH — through direct government scientific work or at research universities that receive billions in NIH research grants — are adopted and transformed into marketed products by private industry.,The Trump rule would apply to all government-backed inventions, but the,focus of the public debate generally has been over drugs.,By creating a licensing system that relied on the private sector to carry on the work started by taxpayer investment, Bayh-Dole is credited with helping fuel the boom in pharmaceutical research and investment over the past four decades.,But the law does not spell out what is meant by requiring drugs be made available to the public on “reasonable terms.”,The law’s co-authors, then-Sens. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Bob Dole (R-Kan.), , in The Washington Post in 2002 that said controlling prices was never their intent. Critics of the law, however, have been quick to note that Dole and Bayh were no longer senators when they wrote that article. Dole, who left the Senate in 1996 during his campaign for president, became a Pfizer TV pitch man for Viagra in 1998; Bayh, who died in 2019, represented the Washington interests of numerous corporate clients after he left the Senate in 1981.,The current fight is being played out in a division of the Commerce Department called the National Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST’s mission is to encourage the transfer of government-sponsored inventions into the private sector.,Among backers of the Trump administration’s proposed rule is AUTM, formerly known as the Association of University Technology Managers. The association maintains that advocates of lower drug prices concocted “hidden meaning” in the Bayh-Dole march-in rights that needs to be definitively ruled out.,Permanently barring price from consideration is crucial to bolstering industry confidence that its licensing deals for taxpayer-supported inventions will not be undermined by government officials, the association maintains.,“We have brilliant researchers who are developing life-changing inventions across the country, and we need to get them into the hands of companies to develop them further. Anything that would perturb that delicate balance is concerning,” said Stephen Susalka, AUTM’s chief executive. “Pricing is outside the scope of Bayh-Dole. That’s the opposite of why Bayh-Dole was initially implemented.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/voltswagen-volkswagen-electric-vehicles/,Volkswagen admits its name change was an April Fools’ Day prank,"Volkswagen is not renaming its U.S. subsidiary Voltswagen, declaring it instead an early April Fools’ Day prank.,Earlier Tuesday, Volkswagen issued a news release and tweet publicly announcing the name change. The company reversed course later that day, saying that the rebranding announcement was, in fact, a stunt to gin up interest in its electric vehicle strategy and the imminent arrival of its first long-range electric SUV.,“There will be no renaming of Volkswagen of America,” Volkswagen spokesman Mark Gillies said in an emailed statement Tuesday night. “The alleged renaming was designed to be an announcement in the spirit of April Fools’ Day, highlighting the launch of the all-electric ID.4 SUV and signaling our commitment to bringing electric mobility to all.”,But the announcement, which came two days before April 1, had already circulated far and wide before Volkswagen backtracked. Several media outlets, including The Washington Post, reported on the name change earlier Tuesday.,That left some branding experts scratching their heads about the strategy — particularly when the auto giant was at the center of a massive emissions scandal in September 2015. At that time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered Volkswagen had rigged millions of diesel cars with cheat devices that allowed them to test as low-emission, when in fact their output was 40 times the legal U.S. limit.,“It just shows a lack of understanding about what this company did and what its standing is in the world and how it needs to rectify its history and rebuild its image,” said Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “Goofing around about who it is and what it’s trying to do, particularly with anything related to sustainability strikes me as really, really bad taste. It’s just terrible.”,On Monday, a version of the rebrand announcement was “accidentally” posted on VW’s website, then disappeared, prompting social media speculation on whether the name change was simply an April Fools’ Day stunt. But VW confirmed the switch-over in a ,, which has now been removed from its website.,A , of the release shows that Volkswagen had said it would adopt the new name in May.,“We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” Scott Keogh, president and chief executive of the company’s U.S. arm said in the release.,Apart from its emissions scandal, Volkswagen also faced an uproar last year when it was , for a racist advertisement posted on its Instagram account. The 10-second clip depicted a pair of oversize White hands dragging a Black man away from a new VW car, and flicking him violently into a restaurant called “Petit Colon,” a name with overtones of colonization. Volkswagen, which was founded by the Nazi government in the 1930s, removed the ad and said it was “an insult to every decent person.”,Companies attempt public April Fools’ stunts nearly every year, attempting to rouse attention for themselves in what they hope to be a fun tone. Google Maps has a history of introducing a feature or game as a prank, participating along with other tech companies such as Reddit and Roku.,Microsoft marketing chief Chris Capossela sent out a note to employees ,announcing that the company had decided against doing any public-facing stunts because “data tells us these stunts have limited positive impact and can actually result in unwanted news cycles.”,Argenti cautions brands against these types of April Fools’ Day stunts in general, though he acknowledges there might be a way for companies to subtly poke fun at themselves.,“But the last thing you would want to do is to call attention to your sustainability in relation to your cause given that you were fined billions of dollars,” he said of Volkswagen.,In June 2016, , to settle shareholder claims tied to the,emissions scandal, in one of the biggest class-action settlements in U.S. history. In January 2017, Volkswagen paid $4.3 billion in criminal and civil fines after pleading guilty in a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. The scandal has cost the German auto giant more than 31 billion euros (more than $34.6 billion) in fines and settlements, executives have said.,Several automakers are doubling down on EVs. In January, General Motors pledged to stop making gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans and SUVs by 2035. Jaguar announced in February that it would go all electric by 2025, and earlier this month Volvo said it would phase out vehicles with internal-combustion engines by 2030.,“A golden age of EV is on the horizon,” Dan Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a February research note.,Headquartered in Herndon, Va., Volkswagen of America is a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, Europe’s biggest automaker.,Even though some found the move controversial, Richard Levick, president and chief executive of crisis communications firm Levick, argued Volkswagen’s move was “brilliant” as a move to remedy its electric vehicles getting overlooked.,“Now everybody is talking about their progress in electric vehicles,” he said. “Now they’ve forever connected electronic vehicles and Volkswagen.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/irs-social-security-stimulus-payment-april-7/,Social Security recipients and most other federal beneficiaries should see direct deposit stimulus payments by April 7,"The IRS and the Treasury Department finally have a payment date for the millions of Social Security recipients and most other federal beneficiaries who do not have to file tax returns.,The majority of their stimulus,payments will be sent electronically, with an official payment date of April 7, according to the , Tuesday.,Stimulus relief payments to federal beneficiaries who do not have recent tax returns on file with the IRS or who did not use the IRS online “non-filers tool” had been delayed, resulting in , among would-be recipients.,[,],In total, about 127 million payments worth , have been distributed over the past three weeks. The ,provides for payments of up to $1,400 for eligible individuals and $2,800 for couples filing joint returns. Dependents, regardless of age, also receive $1,400 each.,The IRS had said it would automatically send economic impact payments, which is what the agency calls the stimulus payments, to people who did not file returns but who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security retirement, survivor or disability (SSDI), Railroad Retirement, or Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits. But many of these federal beneficiaries, including nearly 30 million Social Security and SSI benefit recipients, have been waiting for news about their payments.,“I am a 69-year-old widow living on SSI widow’s benefits,” a Florida woman said by email. “I can use the extra money, and I hear on the news every day how many people in my area have received their third stimulus payment. What is going on? I can really use this money.”,The wait is coming to an end if all goes as planned, the IRS and Treasury said. Now that the IRS has the information it needs from the Social Security Administration, the majority of stimulus payments to federal beneficiaries will be disbursed electronically — through direct deposits or to existing Direct Express cards, which are prepaid debit cards used to deliver federal benefits.,However, stimulus payments for VA beneficiaries, who do not regularly file tax returns, could be delayed,until mid-April. The agency said it is reviewing data for VA benefit recipients and expects to determine a payment date and provide more details soon.,“We know how important these payments are, and we are doing everything we can to make these payments as fast as possible to these important individuals,” IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said in the statement.,Here’s a roundup of other announcements the IRS has made over the past several days.,— ,. The payments are automatic, so there’s nothing beneficiaries have to do. However, some federal benefit recipients still may need to file 2020 tax returns to claim the economic impact payments for qualified dependents. The IRS otherwise will not know to disburse the payments for the dependents.,Also, be aware that the form of payment may be different from in earlier stimulus rounds. So, be sure to check your mail for either a check or prepaid debit card.,[,],Eventually, with updates from IRS, you should be able to check the status of your stimulus payment by using the “,” tool at ,, which is available in English and Spanish.,— , Personal protective equipment — such as masks, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes used to prevent the spread of the , — is now deductible as a medical expense, the IRS , last week.,The IRS said taxpayers can use funds in their health savings accounts (HSAs) or flexible spending account (FSAs) to buy paper and cloth masks. Hand sanitizer and surface cleaners that are used to prevent the spread of the virus also are eligible. With an FSA and HSA, you can set aside money, pretax, to pay certain qualified health expenses.,The contribution limit for an employee who chooses to participate in an FSA is $2,750 for 2021.,Contributions are not subject to federal income tax, Social Security tax or Medicare tax.,Health savings accounts are linked to high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), and, like FSAs, they also can be used for various out-of-pocket expenses. The maximum amount you’re allowed to contribute to an HSA for 2021 is $3,600 as an individual or $7,200 as a family. People 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000 annually to an HSA.,— , In other ,, the IRS said it is giving individuals additional time to make 2020 contributions to their individual retirement accounts, such as an IRA or Roth IRA. The deadline is now May 17, as the IRS has extended the tax season for individuals to May 17.,The annual IRA contribution limit for 2020 is $6,000, plus an additional $1,000 for taxpayers 50 and older.,People funding health savings accounts and , also have until May 17 to make 2020 contributions.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/corporations-racial-justice-cancel-culture/,Corporations are working with social media influencers to cancel-proof their racial justice initiatives ,"Days after , died under the knee of a White police officer, Procter & Gamble began work on an ad campaign aimed at White people simply titled “,.”,Over close-up shots of a pale, freckled back, then a single blue eye, these words appeared: “Being White in America is not needing to state your life matters. And when your life matters, you have power. Now is the time to use it.”,The call to action on prime-time television from one of the world’s largest advertisers was risky.,Advocating for racial allyship is not something corporate America has traditionally embraced. But the , against police brutality last year prompted many companies to , in combating systemic racism and pushing,White Americans to reflect on their understanding of race and privilege — all while trying to increase market share. With every new well-meaning — or opportunistic, depending on the details — effort comes the potential for public and painful missteps.,“We sell Tide,” said Damon Jones, a Procter & Gamble spokesman who leads the company’s racial justice initiatives. “We don’t ever want anyone to be upset at Tide.”,So Procter & Gamble sought outside help to navigate this era of racial justice protests. It joined a growing number of companies consulting diverse panels of “real people” with cultural expertise — community leaders, activists and academics — on everything from ad campaigns to whether to celebrate Black History Month, according to Joshua DuBois, chief executive of Gauge, a technology company connecting corporations with a vast network of social media influencers.,“Traditional market research is not built for this cultural moment,” DuBois said. He and co-founders Brandon Andrews and Alfred Dunn recently launched a “cultural navigator” platform called NXTLAB of more than 10,000 opinion-makers whom companies can tap confidentially for candid feedback to spare themselves possible embarrassment.,Their expertise covers multigenerational, multiracial perspectives on racial equality as well as LGBTQ, gender and women’s rights.,Among the platform’s thought leaders: April Reign, who launched the #OscarsSoWhite campaign for more diverse representation in Hollywood; Jamilah Lemieux, a millennial writer focused on race and gender; and David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a civil rights organization focused on Black LGBTQ people.,The influencers are paid between $500 and more than $1,500 for one-on-one consultations,and $10 to $100 for survey responses, DuBois said. Gauge charges companies a subscription fee (starting at $5,000 a month for nonprofit groups) that includes daily emails encapsulating key news developments, access to a website featuring experts weighing in on those moments, and a set number of custom research projects.,The goal, DuBois said, is an “equitable economy for cultural understanding” where leaders of color are paid for helping brands avoid major mistakes in their ad campaigns, corporate policies, diversity and inclusion plans, philanthropy and product launches.,Some firms have been warned against making pronouncements that could be dismissed by consumers as exploitative, DuBois said.,“A couple of companies wanted to launch big Black History Month marketing campaigns and our community said, ‘Do not do that because you haven’t fulfilled , after Breonna Taylor and George Floyd,’” DuBois said. “You need to put your money where your mouth is in terms of actual work first.”,No company wants to be canceled, even temporarily. Take Pepsi, whose , featuring Kendall Jenner strutting through a protest to deliver a can of soda to a police officer drew consumer backlash and was pulled. Or Starbucks, whose short-lived 2015 campaign for baristas to scrawl “,” on millions of coffee cups in hopes of sparking conversations about racial tensions was criticized as insincere corporatism.,Each marketing misfire provokes a cycle of consumer outrage and calls to boycott, followed by corporate apologies and promises to do better. Instead of being dragged on social media by influencers with large numbers of followers, DuBois said companies can engage them well ahead of any campaign launch.,“These are the people who make good or bad ideas trend, shaping the culture every day,” DuBois said. “It would be a market failure to not tap into this wisdom.”,International makeup chain Sephora convened the NXTLAB network to guide a study on racial bias in retail, and, in January to reduce discriminatory practices in its stores and diversify its product lines. Tech company Snap tapped the network to think more deeply about how to develop inclusive augmented reality tools.,They’ve helped corporations featuring Black models and actors in ad campaigns to also consider diversity in size and skin tone. They’ve advised companies on how to show up — even virtually — at events such as last summer’s , honoring the , of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “,” address at the Lincoln Memorial. And they’ve recommended against using the word “,” in television show titles.,“When you can ease someone into a conversation about representation and discrimination, it’s easier than banging someone over the head with it,” said Reign,,a trained lawyer turned equity advocate. “Easing someone in can lead to faster results because there is less pushback.”,In 2017, Procter & Gamble received more than 10,000 letters and phone calls, the most “hate mail” the company says it’s ever received, accusing the company of “race baiting” after it released a , directly addressing the racism their children face in American life.,“‘,’ was the first controversial campaign that we did, designed to get people talking about racial bias — bias that exists within the walls of P&G, within the advertising industry, within a lot of different places,” Jones said. “Frankly, when we saw the reaction, we knew we needed to continue that discussion.”,So executives forged ahead with another racially provocative campaign titled “,” in 2019.,This time, though, it sought feedback from influencers that Gauge had tapped early on in a beta version of the platform before launching this spring. The racially diverse group helped P&G adjust the intensity of the actors’ facial expressions and emotions. The result: a more subtle film depicting the daily microaggressions experienced by Black men — no matter how accomplished. No words. Just telling glances.,“The challenge was to show the action and the emotion in a true and pure way such that Black men said yes, that’s my experience,” Jones said, “and in a way that White people didn’t get turned off because we were waving the finger and accusing them of being racist.”,“These conversations are so nuanced and our goal is to bring people together,” Jones said. “It is much more layered than just telling the truth.”,The spot listed a company website with , about racial bias, including a ,, which Jones said P&G created with the help of the Gauge influencers. With the company better prepared for the public reaction than when it released “The Talk,” Jones said P&G was able to launch dozens of community conversations in schools across the nation. “We want to be more effective in drawing people into the discussion rather than just driving people back into their corners,” he said.,Jones said that P&G recognizes that its messaging projected into consumer homes shapes how communities see themselves and each other. That’s why it felt compelled to issue a directive to White people to step up in the fight against racial injustice after Floyd’s killing, when it released “,” online and across major network and cable TV channels.,The emphasis this time was less on blame, he said, but on the fact that everyone has a role to play in fixing societal structures that are biased against Black people. And public reception was much more balanced as more corporations began speaking out about social justice issues, he said.,“The intent was to get the silent majority actively involved,” Jones said. “We didn’t want to just create another ad or film. We needed people to act differently.”,Promoting community discussions and encouraging White Americans to fight for racial justice seems far afield for a company that sells toilet paper, toothpaste and tampons. But for many companies, pressure came from consumers as well as their own employees — and ultimately, they say, standing up for racial justice can help increase their bottom line.,Sonya Grier, an American University professor whose research focuses on race in the marketplace, said corporations have not traditionally advocated for marginalized groups and instead focused on targeting groups most profitable to them.,“They are now trying to support a community so they have sustainability within the marketing systems that they have,” Grier said. “It’s like smoothing the ground in ways to still accomplish the goals they want to accomplish — which is to sell products and make money.”,Black and Hispanic consumers are more likely now to expect brands to take a stance on social justice issues, according to a ,. The market research firm has also reported that Black shoppers typically , on cosmetics, hair products and skin care than White consumers, amounting to , each year. And Black consumers are more likely than other demographic groups to speak up through social media.,Sephora, which Black shoppers have ,, first worked with Gauge experts in 2019 to better understand how Black women leaders view the beauty company and experience racial profiling in retail. They wanted Sephora to sell more representative products, including those reflecting the full array of Black skin tones, and forge relationships with more Black influencers.,Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Yeh said Sephora has since commissioned a panel of equity advisers for quarterly conversations to complement its traditional market research.,When Sephora pledged to devote at least 15 percent of its shelf space to Black-owned beauty brands last summer,,Yeh said the equity advisers urged the company to also create a path for Black entrepreneurs by expanding recruiting and ensuring they knew the “secret sauce” to making it onto Sephora shelves.,“The biggest trade show in beauty is in Milan. Are they going to be in Milan? Probably not,” Yeh said. “We are digging much deeper into scouting, beyond just letting them come to us.”,Sephora has re-engineered its,six-year-old,brand development,program — initially created to help women access funding, create prototypes and position their products — to focus exclusively on entrepreneurs of color,,with the intent to distribute at Sephora at the end of the six-month boot camp. And it’s tapping some of the equity advisers to act as mentors and to connect with a more diverse group of business owners.,The company has also increased signage in its stores of up-and-coming brands, with mini-profiles of the founders, Yeh said, because “consumers want to know.”,“The speed at which cultural conversations are taking place is breathtaking and the breadth of those conversations are really expanding,” Yeh said. “It’s helpful for us to have a pulse on something that’s broader than what we had in the past.”,Lauryl Schraedly, global head of consumer insights on Snap’s marketing team, said the Gauge network is “unlike anything else in the industry,” something especially valuable at this time because “a lot of people in the market research industry look like me, a White woman.”,Snap began working with the influencers last summer and has sought help understanding which events and issues that brands should be a part of, getting feedback on how people are using its augmented reality filters and staying informed on what various communities care about.,In 2016, the company was pilloried for a Snapchat , that allowed users to put Marley’s face and dreadlocks on themselves and another that turned users into a , with slanted eyes, buck teeth and a conical hat. Critics said the filters amounted to digital blackface and yellowface.,Last June, it released a , commemorating ,, a holiday marking emancipation, that prompted users to smile to break digital chains symbolizing slavery. The company apologized, removed the filter and attributed its error to internal miscommunication.,Two months later, during the March on Washington, Snap unveiled filters and other creative tools designed by Black artists that support ,, including , advocating for racial justice that could be also purchased in real life.,After commissioning a study in December,on how companies have celebrated ,, Snap in February,released a,, a Black cowboy on his journey to becoming the best bull rider in the world. It also rolled out bitmoji celebrating “Black excellence,” including one promoting Black history “24/7/365.”,“We can’t just show up in February and then go silent for the rest of the year,” Schraedly said.,Producing effective campaigns promoting racial justice also helps companies better sell their products, said Jones, of Procter & Gamble. The company is working with Gauge to address systemic bias in the marketing and advertising industry and , to tell more inclusive stories about Black America.,“There is an economic benefit as well as a societal benefit,” Jones said. “When you get this stuff right, it’s good for business.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/hybrid-office-remote-work-citigroup-ford-target/,The hybrid office is here to stay. The shift could be more disruptive than the move to all-remote work.,"The post-vaccine,workplace is taking shape, and for many it’s going to be a hybrid model, allowing more remote work but with clear expectations that some days a week will be in the office.,Workforce experts are bracing for a whole new set of post-pandemic upheavals, in some instances more transformative than the unplanned move to working from home last March, with some making efforts to avoid pre-pandemic,remote-work mistakes.,“In a lot of ways it’s going to be more disruptive than when we went all remote,” said Brian Kropp, vice president of research at Gartner.,New videoconferencing technology will be added to help in-person and remote workers feel as if they’re on a level playing field. Managers will undergo extensive training to fight against the instinct to give workers in the office preferential treatment. Logistics will be coordinated to ensure those who go into the office don’t get there and find the building empty, perhaps by setting core hours or days for on-site work.,A growing number of major employers of white-collar workers have announced return-to-work plans in recent weeks, outlining a mix of in-person and virtual work that is being described as permanent, or a “new normal.”,Citigroup chief executive Jane Fraser , in a memo that the majority of workers would be designated as hybrid, with an expectation that they would work at least three days in the office. Ford , March 17 that 30,000 of its North American office workers would be allowed to work under a flexible hybrid model in which they are on-site for certain meetings or projects and stay home for independent work.,The investment firm TIAA , the vast majority of its workers would be hybrid, while Target , that it would be ending the lease at one of its downtown Minneapolis headquarters buildings after telling employees in February that most office workers would follow a hybrid approach.,The announcements, while still hazy on details, mark an inflection point in companies’ efforts to return to the office.,“The number one question I’m getting from companies is how do we do hybrid workforce planning,” said ,, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of the forthcoming book “,.” “They have to do their planning on what that post-pandemic future will look like,” she said.,It’s the hope, it’s the optimism, based on the fact that many people have been vaccinated.”,During the first year of the pandemic, a host of tech companies, such as ,, announced they would let employees go remote on a permanent basis, prompting predictions of a virtual future, abandoned , and a geographic free-for-all that would let staffers work from anywhere.,Google called in December for at least,three , a week,in the office and two days out, while Microsoft said , that working remotely up to half the time would be considered ,. (Microsoft said , it would begin bringing workers back to its campus March 29.),Yet the more recent announcements from non-tech companies give the clearest indication yet that the hybrid model is here to stay, workforce experts say.,“When these other companies are making this move, who have historically been more conservative or have much less of a start-up mentality — when those companies are making a move, they’re a bellwether,” Kropp said. “It shows this is becoming more common.”,Companies say they’re responding to employee expectations. In January, 44 percent of U.S. workers working remotely surveyed by , said they prefer to work from home once restrictions are lifted, while 39 percent said they want to return to the office.,Lockheed Martin, which estimates,that between 40 and 45 percent of its workforce would be “multidimensional” — its term for hybrid — has put its managers through roughly 20 hours of training, some of which focused on having a “growth mind-set,” a term coined by researcher Carol Dweck that refers to someone’s skills and abilities having the potential to change and grow.,“This is a new world, and you have to accept it as such,” said Greg Karol, Lockheed Martin’s chief human resources officer. “We were a company with only 3 percent full-time telecommuters a year ago. You move to this new phase, I don’t expect them to be experts.”,Sara Wechter, Citigroup’s global head of human resources, said the company plans to start inviting employees in North America back to the office in July and hopes about 50 percent can return to the office part time in September. It designated each job in the company as “resident,” “remote” or “hybrid,” with the vast majority falling into the last category.,“I cannot picture Citi ever saying we’re going fully remote,” Wechter said. Yet whereas in the past the default was that an employee would work on-site, in the future the default will be hybrid, she said. Fraser’s memo was an effort to be clear that “we’re better together,” Wechter said. “At the end of the day we’ve proven we can work in a hybrid situation. We can work from home. There’s got to be the balance.”,The law firm Allen & Overy said recently that it plans to eventually bring its lawyers back in the office about 60 percent of the time but that it won’t measure hybrid schedules on a weekly basis. “Our expectation is you will organize your working life so that 60 percent of that working time over a year is spent in the office,” said Tim House, the firm’s U.S. senior partner.,Decisions will be left up to individual partners on how to bring people in, and teams might work several weeks at a time,in the office while finishing a project and then spend a couple weeks out of it. But he expects the change to be permanent. “It will be a paradigm shift and one that will endure,” he said, with the firm going from one that was “permissive” of flexible work in certain arrangements “to one that is now communicating that the appropriate balance is 60 percent in the office.”,At TIAA, roughly 85 percent of its workforce is expected to work between two and four days in the office. That’s a much better model, said TIAA Chief People Officer Sean Woodroffe, than one the firm had in the past, when a large percentage of people were fully remote. By 2018, roughly 30 to 40 percent of TIAA’s employees were working from home full time, a level considered high for the financial services industry at the time and one it realized wasn’t working, hurting collaboration. Before the pandemic, it was down to just 15 percent remote in 2019, with the firm calling off-site workers back in.,When too many workers are remote, “you run into issues that people that are in the office have face time, they have opportunities, they’re interacting with employees a little bit differently than the employees that are working remotely,” Woodroffe said. When most employees have some time on-site and some working from home, it should help with,those concerns, he said. “What we’re moving to is something that’s completely different.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/fed-inflation-bad-economy-low-wage/,The soft underbelly to a looming economic boom: Millions will miss out,"A major reason the Federal Reserve insists Americans shouldn’t fret about the risk of runaway inflation boils down to a letter Alexia Figueroa received from the hotel she worked at for 15 years.,Figueroa was furloughed from her job as a restaurant hostess and server at the Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel in Boston last March, and she’s waited for the call to come back ever since. The job helped her family buy a house and provided health insurance for her two children.,Then last week, Figueroa learned that she and , had been fired.,“The recovery looks like it is coming soon, but when they sent me the letter saying I don’t have the job, it’s like they are keeping me away from the recovery,” Figueroa, 39, said. “To find another hospitality job is hard for me in this moment.”,By many accounts, the economy is projected to grow at its , in four decades this year, bolstered by President Biden’s , and more widespread ,. The rosier picture has economists , whether such a forceful turnaround will overheat the economy and trigger cycles of inflation ,The Fed ,. Its explanation typically includes academic debates about ,or what the mathematical link is between unemployment and prices.,But the answer this time is also much simpler: Despite the headline numbers, the economy is still in bad shape for millions of Americans. And for many workers like Figueroa, jobs may not come back even if the economy booms again.,The bleak reality is coming into sharper focus as the Biden administration , an at least $3 trillion infrastructure and jobs package on Wednesday, one that’s designed to confront global climate change and rebuild America’s roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The package could provide additional support to the economy in the years to come, but there are more imminent challenges, especially as , cases , across the United States.,All the while, the scars of pandemic are far from healed.,The leisure and , sector — which largely employs people of color and women — is down almost 3.5 million jobs, or roughly 20 percent of its pre-pandemic level. Workers who had been in the bottom 25 percent of earners faced an unemployment rate of around 22 percent in February, compared with the , of 6.2 percent, according to a , last week by Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard,Economists say many of the 9.5 million jobs still missing from the labor market will gradually return. But it’s unclear how long it will take, and which jobs will vanish forever in the meantime. Businesses are increasingly looking to technology and automation to cut the cost of labor, compounding the risks of long-term unemployment for some of the country’s most vulnerable workers.,The bleak picture shows the darker side of the Fed’s plan to keep interest rates near zero for quite awhile. Historically, the Fed raised rates and slowed the economy to keep inflation from creeping too high, even at the cost of higher unemployment.,Now the Fed goes by a ,, one that tolerates higher inflation if that means more people can get a job.,But if all of that growth leaves behind people like Figueroa, the Fed’s path to getting as many people back to work as possible will be even harder to forge.,“Although the outlook has brightened considerably, the fog of uncertainty associated with the virus has yet to lift completely, and current employment and inflation outcomes remain far from our goals,” Brainard said last week.,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell has , that getting the pandemic , is the best way to heal the economy. Vaccinations help people return to jobs that depend on person-to-person contact, Powell says. As people spend money on long-awaited vacations and entertainment, hotels and concert venues will be able to bring workers back on the payroll, for example.,But some jobs may never return. In her speech, Brainard cited a , that found roughly half of chief financial officers from large firms and about one-third of those from small firms, said they were “using, or planning to use, automation or technology to reduce reliance on labor.”,Many companies already had plans to automate jobs before the pandemic. But Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told The Washington Post that the pandemic accelerated that shift. Kaplan said it’s hard to think of a business in his district — which spans Texas and parts of Louisiana and New Mexico — that doesn’t mention automation and ways to trim costs in their conversations.,Restaurants are using technology for online preorders and pickups, Kaplan said. Package delivery and logistics centers are on a similar path. Call centers that were already exploring ways to automate will likely ramp up those efforts, Kaplan said.,In other cases, businesses say they can’t predict how quickly customer demand will rebound as the pandemic winds down, making them hesitant to rehire.,“What I’m hearing from small businesses, medium-sized businesses and large business is that wherever possible right now, they’re looking for ways to use technology more than in the past to run leaner, and to be more efficient,” Kaplan said.,Such permanent shifts in the labor market could pose a crucial test for the Fed. The central bank is supposed to guard against inflation — the annual change in the price of goods and services — and get the economy to full employment. Its main policy lever rests in interest rates, which the Fed can raise or lower depending on what’s happening in the economy.,Inflation , the Fed’s 2 percent target for years, even as unemployment fell in the years after the Great Recession. That dynamic , the long-held view that as the labor market tightened and employers raised wages to compete for scarce workers, prices would rise as businesses passed high labor costs onto consumers.,Inflation is expected to , this year, but Powell says any price increases will be temporary and won’t pulse through the entire economy. Still, economists and , are trying to pin down how much inflation the Fed will tolerate before it raises rates.,Just as important will be how the Fed judges progress in the labor market, particularly for low-wage workers and people of color who didn’t benefit until the tail end of the expansion that followed the Great Recession.,Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, described the uneven recovery as “the signature characteristic” of the pandemic’s economic fallout. In a , last week, Bostic highlighted disparities across wage levels, gender, race and industry and said eliminating persistent gaps “is essential if we are to generate stronger economic growth.”,When it comes to monetary policy, Bostic said looking to the overall unemployment rate won’t be enough.,“I’m going to be committed to pushing back against the notion that we’re all fine if the aggregate number is at a certain point, but some of these targeted populations are still in significant distress, or in a more of a crisis type of period,” Bostic told reporters last week.,the official unemployment rate ,. They say a more precise gauge is the employment-to-population ratio, which measures the number of people currently employed against the total working-age population.,The ratio for Black prime-age workers is 7.2 percentage points lower than for White workers, which is 77.8 percent. The ratio is 6.2 percentage points lower for Hispanic workers than for White workers — an increase in each gap of about three percentage points from pre-pandemic lows in October 2019, according to Brainard’s speech.,Measuring how many people are still out of work is one challenge. Making sense of this unusual and complex crisis is yet another.,Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, says there are still “a lot of asterisks” when assessing the health of the U.S. economy. Three rounds of ,, enhanced unemployment benefits and a host of other relief measures have all helped families stay afloat over the past year.,The unprecedented levels of fiscal support make it hard to draw clear-cut conclusions about the labor market, for example. At the same time, Wozniak notes that , have been able to,blurring the picture even more.,“The unemployment rate is dramatically worse than we’ve seen in the past, but the level of support is dramatically better,” Wozniak said. “And so when we try to create this picture of overall well-being, we’re just in a very new territory.”,Eventually, the flood of support from Congress will wear off. Businesses that experiment with leaner staffs or automation may decide to stick with it.,And economists fear that the longer people are out of the workforce, the harder it is to get back in.,“While there’s some exuberance, rightfully so, that the economy is going to rebound and rebound fast, and we’re going to see a lot of growth, the way that will be experienced by workers is going to be just as uneven and unequal as the recession was,” said Molly Kinder, who focuses on low-wage workers and women at the Brookings Institution.,That is Figueroa’s worry too.,Figueroa, who is from El Salvador, said she’s depended on stimulus payments and extended unemployment benefits to help support her family. Her husband also works in hospitality as a server, but he is only employed two days per week.,She fears what losing her job means for her family’s financial stability and worries about paying her mortgage. The Unite Here Local 26 Union, which represents much of Kimpton Nine Zero’s staff, said the company violated its contract and did not have grounds to fire its employees. In a statement, the hotel said its actions “comply with the union contract that has been in place for years.”,Other Boston hotels have committed to recalling their own workers if business returns, making it more difficult for her to find a position. Figueroa says she has the training, but she needs the job.,“We are here, ready to work,” Figueroa said. “We already know our job, so we don’t have to train as much. We know what we do, and we love what we do.”"

Protracted economic sanctions on Xinjiang — the heart of China’s cotton production — could permanently reroute some supply chains out of China. The Xinjiang crackdown, which the U.S. State Department has declared “genocide,” also threatens to become a defining part of President Xi Jinping’s historical legacy.,Deborah Mayersen, an Australian expert in genocide prevention, said Beijing’s threats to Western companies were directed at a domestic audience as much as the foreign one, with senior officials seeking to project legitimacy at home in the face of sanctions.,“China is trying to win a propaganda war at home,” she said.,China’s Xinjiang policies , to impose on March 22 its first sanctions on China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. The E.U. , by the United States, Britain and Canada, in a coordinated approach.,Beijing has struck back steadily since then, first with sanctions on officials in the E.U. and Britain. Over the weekend, , several U.S. and Canadian officials: Gayle Manchin, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom; the commission’s vice chair, Tony Perkins; Canadian Parliament member Michael Chong; and an international human rights subcommittee of Canada’s House of Commons.,U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken , Beijing’s reaction on Saturday: “Beijing’s attempts to silence criticism of serious human rights abuse in Xinjiang only contributes to growing international scrutiny.”,China also extended its sanctions to academic scholars, raising concerns that the campaign would have a chilling effect on research. The Mercator Institute for China Studies, which is the largest European think tank focused on China, and Newcastle University anthropologist Joanne Smith Finley were targeted by Beijing last week.,By Sunday, more than 400 scholars had signed a letter of support for Finley.,“The Chinese Communist Party has long used covert attempts to silence critics outside its territory, but these overt new measures against academics are a serious escalation,” said the letter they signed, ,.,Chinese state media have also , that unspecified Xinjiang companies were planning to sue Adrian Zenz, a prominent U.S.-based Xinjiang researcher.,Human rights activists issued calls over the weekend for fashion brands to resist caving in to China’s threats of boycott. Human Rights Watch , Inditex, the parent company of Zara; PVH, parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein; and VF, parent company of the North Face and JanSport, have all since removed statements on Xinjiang.,

The slow vaccine rollout in Europe has put the brakes on a quick comeback there. Questions linger over whether American consumers will flock to theaters. Warner Bros., which has some of theaters’ most anticipated movies, will continue to release its films ,on HBO Max through the end of the year, flouting the so-called theatrical window.,And Disney this week , it would roll out its Marvel title “Black Widow” and “101 Dalmatians”-set picture “Cruella” on Disney Plus at the same time as theaters, further delaying exclusive new product.,But Greidinger, Cineworld’s chief executive, believes bright days lie just ahead. He has made a decision to begin opening Regal theaters in the U.S. ,. The Israel-based executive (he started his career at his family’s chain Cinema City before it became part of Cineworld) has also just cut a deal with Warner Bros. for a 45-day window in the U.S. And he is maintaining his optimism despite the Disney news, which he says deeply disappointed him.,The Washington Post talked to him by phone from Tel Aviv. (The conversation has been compressed and edited lightly for clarity.),Of course I’m upset. Movies like “Cruella” and “Black Widow” deserve a significant window to get maximum revenue. Disney’s gross in 2019 alone is more than $13 billion [worldwide]. I believe it’s a mistake. But it’s not my decision to make.,I am sure at the end of day there will be a solution. Maybe not for these movies, maybe for the future. But they just made the announcement two days ago. We’ll wait and see how it develops and then make our decisions.,This is the nature of partnership; sometimes you have to give things up. It was clear Warner Bros. could not back off the commitment it made. For us, we were willing to compromise on a few movies for the sake of the future.,I don’t think I can hide fact that I didn’t like it. But I’m not a guy with bad blood. I explained my view to Warner Bros. before they took the decision and afterward. There was some tension; there was some business negotiation. At the end of the day, I think we got a good deal.,Our relationships with the studios go back over 90 years. It’s a partnership. Studios need cinemas and cinemas need studios. We accept windows cannot be as long as they were in [the] past. I don’t think any studio opposes the view that theatrical exclusivity is a must, that it’s the best way to maximize income from movies. I think this [WB] deal is setting a tone, which is so important for the industry. I hope in the coming weeks we’re able to move forward with Paramount, Sony, Disney and, of course, with Universal.,Of course, for much of 2020 we were bleeding money. But we have also been raising a lot of money. We just raised $200 million more [through a ,. We have enough liquidity for the reopening and will be cash-flow positive very soon after.,We have good liquidity even until the end of the year. I’m not worried, but I’m cautious. I’m preparing ourselves for a bad situation. But I’m sure this time it will be good.,We’ve closed 20 theaters [out of about 750] across all our territories. About 17 of them are in the U.S. All of them were underperforming, and we could reach agreements with landlords where we could leave early. We didn’t lose any of our flagships. And we’re going to open five new theaters. Each of these new cinemas will probably do the business of three old cinemas.,It was really disappointing. I was ready to bet that everything would be back in June, latest July. If someone would have told me that it would be a year and still theaters are closed, I would think he’s crazy.,The first quarter has been very frustrating. On the other hand, we’re now counting vaccinations instead of test results. I’m sure Europe will move forward quickly once they solve this issue. In July the theatrical business will be back there. Not at 2019 levels. But completely different from where it stands now. We’re also now standing in a situation with “Godzilla vs. Kong” as the first release [next week] in the United States. In May I think we can be in full force in the U.S.,I think you just need to look at Asia. In China and Japan [where covid cases have subsided and theaters have reopened] they’re breaking records — not covid records but all-time records. It’s amazing to think a new Chinese-language movie like , is the biggest opening ever in the history of the industry in one territory — bigger even than “Avengers.” It showed the promise of entertainment. I cannot count how many people have asked me when the new “Top Gun” will come out, when “Matrix” will come out.,The human being’s nature is not to stay home seven days a week. It’s to go out at least once or twice a week, whether it’s to a park or a restaurant or a cinema. There’s nothing to compare laughing together, crying together, being frightened together. A boy dating a girl for the first time does not want to sit in the living room with his parents.,It always happens in our industry. It’s 120 years old, and there are so many times someone says, “This will be the end of cinema,” and then it survives. Cinema will live forever."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/26/usps-dejoy-act/,Democrats introduce ‘DeJoy Act’ in opening salvo against USPS leader’s mail-slowing plan,"Democrats are swarming to block a key piece of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s 10-year restructuring plan for the U.S. Postal Service, casting doubt on the feasibility of his proposals for achieving financial stability for the agency.,A group of House Democrats on Friday introduced legislation to prohibit the Postal Service from lengthening mail-delivery windows and require it to adhere to present service expectations. They named the bill the Delivering Envelopes Judiciously On-time Year-round Act, or DEJOY Act.,One House aide involved in postal reform legislation introduced in February said some members of the caucus are leery of proceeding with efforts to address the Postal Service’s financial obligations given that DeJoy’s 10-year plan includes sharp reductions in service, including slower timetables for mail delivery and reduced post office hours.,Separately, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D), to block the service cuts. His office said in a statement Friday that it was encouraged that DeJoy recognizes the legal obligations to secure limited regulatory approvals, but said it remained concerned about timely mail delivery.,Mounting concern among Democrats, who can afford few defections from their narrow House majority if they hope to pass postal reform, could throw off the postmaster general’s entire “Delivering for America” proposal.,DeJoy hopes to save the Postal Service $160 billion over the next decade through a combination of austerity measures, postage price increases and projected package volume growth. But the largest single piece of his plan is dependent on Congress repealing its pre-funding mandate for retiree health care costs, which runs about $5 billion a year. Instead, the agency wants to wind down those payments and enroll future retirees in Medicare, a proposal worth $44 billion.,A bill introduced by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, chair of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee, includes both components.,But DeJoy’s designs to slow the mail — even as the Postal Service attempts to rebound from generationally poor service metrics in recent months — and perceived animus toward lawmakers in recent hearings have made those prospects more difficult.,Under current “service standards,” or the amount of time the Postal Service allots itself to deliver a piece of mail, it should take no more than three days for a first-class mail item to arrive, regardless of where it is being sent in the United States. Under DeJoy’s new plan, the three-day standard would still apply to 70 percent of first-class mail items. But for the remaining 30 percent — which is roughly 5 billion pieces of mail — the benchmark will go from three to as many as five days based on destination mileage.,“This particular change, going from 100 percent of first-class mail being delivered one to three days to only 70 percent, would be a nonstarter, in my opinion, with the American people,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who introduced the DEJOY Act with six Democratic co-sponsors, told The Washington Post.,DeJoy’s plan presents service cuts as a necessity given falling mail volume, inconsistency in the Postal Service’s largely private-sector “middle mile” transportation network and spiraling transportation costs required to ferry fewer pieces of mail cross-country.,Postal Service spokesman David Partenheimer said in an emailed statement that the agency would “strongly oppose a freeze on the current unachieved and unachievable service standards,” and said that though the agency had tried to meet delivery expectations in recent years, it largely has fallen short.,“The modifications we are proposing will enable us to improve reliability by shifting volume from unreliable air transportation to more reliable ground transportation,” Partenheimer said, “and facilitate network improvements that will ensure that we can meet or exceed 95 percent on-time delivery across all of our mail and shipping product classes during all times of the year.”,In an interview Tuesday, DeJoy told The Post that the Postal Service did not view the cuts as a fundamental disruption in service, and that the agency has already submitted plans to the Postal Regulatory Commission to change service standards.,“We do not believe that any of these changes that we are proposing or moving forward on are hugely impacting or changing the structure and the service of the Postal Service,” DeJoy said.,The Postal Service’s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, cautioned during a Tuesday webinar announcing the plan that failure to swiftly adopt any of its tenets would come with significant ramifications.,“If we encounter roadblocks with any of the major elements, we quickly get into negative territory and may face annual losses for the coming decade,” Corbett said. “The scale of consequences from being constrained or slowed in our implementation of initiatives would be sizable.”,But mail industry experts worry that degrading service standards could chase away businesses that can no longer afford or tolerate slower, more expensive delivery. DeJoy’s plan also calls for price increases, but he declined to disclose them in the webinar or in the interview. Several mailing firms and advocacy organizations are suing the agency’s regulator to block it from allowing the Postal Service to raise prices.,Industry officials are also critical of the plan’s pivot toward the Postal Service’s package business and away from paper mail. DeJoy in the interview with The Post said he was “not a magician” and “I can’t create the need for mail.”,“In the entire fifty-eight pages of the plan there does not appear to be any effort to retain mail volume,” PostCom, a national postal commerce advocacy group, wrote in its Thursday industry bulletin. “Apart from price increases and service reductions, there is little about mail in the plan at all. That’s inaction.”,“This part of the plan will drive mail volume down to levels not seen since before it reached 100 billion in 1980,” the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers wrote in its newsletter. “If we mailers win our federal lawsuit, the plan is sunk.”,Lawmakers are beginning to share that concern as they are bombarded with calls from local constituents worried about if their medications, paychecks and bills will arrive late. Already over the summer when DeJoy implemented a smaller round of service cuts, major mail-order pharmacies told Senate investigators that some patients experienced “significant” delays in receiving mailed prescriptions. In recent months, untold numbers of consumers have complained of late fees assessed on bills that were held up in the mail.,“This is the best way to kill your business,” Krishnamoorthi said, “which is to basically say to your customers, ‘We’re not going to meet your expectations.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/26/wealthy-tax-evasion/,"The richest 1 percent dodge taxes on more than one-fifth of their income, study shows","The richest Americans are hiding more than 20 percent of their earnings from the Internal Revenue Service, ,, with the top 1 percent of earners accounting for more than a third of all unpaid federal taxes.,That’s costing the federal government roughly $175 billion a year in revenue, according to the findings by a team of economists from academia and the IRS.,The data comes as Senate Democrats , to reduce inequality and fund their legislative priorities.,President Biden, in a sharp reversal from his predecessor, has signaled that he wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, corporations and estates.,The researchers say that years of IRS funding cuts, combined with the increased sophistication of tax evasion tactics available to the rich, have made shirking tax obligations easier than ever. And they say that these estimates probably understate the true extent of tax evasion at the top of the income spectrum.,To catch tax cheats and measure evasion, the IRS randomly audits returns. But such reviews turn up very little evidence of evasion among the extremely wealthy, in part because the rich use sophisticated accounting techniques that are difficult to trace, such as offshore tax shelters, , and ,.,The IRS attempts to correct for this through a number of statistical methods. But the new study finds that even the IRS’s standard corrections underestimate the true extent of tax evasion among the rich.,The researchers were able to demonstrate this after the IRS and Justice Department initiated a crackdown on tax evasion in 2008. That effort led to the creation of the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, which allowed taxpayers to disclose previously hidden offshore assets and pay a penalty in exchange for immunity from prosecution. According to the IRS, , before it shut down in 2018.,Hundreds of those taxpayers, as it turns out, had also been randomly audited before the creation of the program. The researchers matched those audits with the subsequent disclosures, and found that IRS auditors missed the offshore assets roughly 93 percent of the time.,These riches sheltered overseas, moreover, were concentrated almost exclusively among the very top earners.,The study also uncovered evidence of widespread underreporting of income among proprietors of pass-through businesses, whose revenue is taxed on their owners’ returns. “Up to 35% of the income earned at the top is not comprehensively examined in the context of random audits,” the authors found.,Factoring in underreporting from overseas tax shelters and pass-through businesses alone, the authors produced an estimate of the true distribution of tax evasion in the United States. Taxpayers in the bottom half of the income spectrum evade taxes on around 7 percent of their income. Among the top fifth of taxpayers, however, avoidance rises to around 10 percent.,But evasion peaks among the richest 5 percent, who have an income of at least $200,000 and who, as a cohort, capture more than one-third of total national earnings. Taxpayers in this group hide more than 20 percent of their income from tax collectors.,In total, nearly $1 out of every $12 earned in the United States is sheltered from federal income taxes because of the sophisticated evasion techniques of people earning more than $200,000 a year.,“The IRS needs a lot more resources from Congress,” said Daniel Reck, a lead author of the study, via email. He said the agency should “invest in more comprehensive examination strategies, involving audits of individuals, pass-through businesses, and other private entities (charities, trusts, etc.). It needs to hire and train large numbers of experts to conduct those more comprehensive examinations.”,“They can absolutely do all of this, but budget cuts have severely curtailed their ability to do it,” he added.,Since 2010, total funding for the IRS fell by about 20 percent, according to , by IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. The number of enforcement staff employed by the agency fell 30 percent over the same period.,Those staffing cuts have, in turn, driven a sharp drop in audit rates, especially for wealthy taxpayers. In the mid-2010s, close to 30 percent of the returns of the richest 0.01 percent of taxpayers — those earning at least $10 million a year — were typically audited. By 2019, that number had fallen to well under 10 percent.,Steven Rosenthal, a tax policy expert at the Urban Institute who was not involved with the research, cautioned that tax return data from the pre-offshore crackdown era may be limited in terms of what it can tell us about evasion today.,“Since the 2000s, the IRS effectively shut down offshore accounts by aggressive enforcement, reporting, etc.,” he said via email. “And I do not see why we would expect taxpayers who used offshore accounts in the 2000s to migrate to other unlawful activity.”,But, Reck countered, “it would be a big mistake to claim that offshore evasion is virtually nonexistent in 2021.” To prove his case, he points to , claiming large banks continued to help wealthy clients stash money offshore after the crackdown, , criticizing the IRS for not pursuing offshore evasion aggressively enough, and the , Robert Brockman on tax evasion charges involving offshore holdings.,“People might have a harder time simply stashing wealth in Switzerland now, but they can still create complex networks of offshore and US entities and adopt ludicrously aggressive tax positions, like Brockman did,” Reck said.,Rosenthal also noted that the distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion gets extremely muddy at the top of the income spectrum, where billionaires such as Donald Trump employ teams of lawyers and accountants to push the limits of what the tax code allows — in Trump’s case, , on millions of dollars in income.,“Lowering your tax bill from many complicated structures is not clearly unlawful,” he said. “The IRS might win or lose in court,” or they might simply opt for a settlement somewhere in the middle.,“Hiring more agents would help,” he added. But, “the solution to this avoidance at the top end is write better tax rules.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/03/democrats-stimulus-spending-inflation/,"In Democrats’ progressive paradise, borrowing is free, spending pays for itself, and interest rates never rise","Welcome, fellow Americans, to the era of the free lunch.,To hear it from liberal economists, progressive activists and Democratic politicians, there is no longer any limit to how much money government can borrow and spend and print.,In this new economy, we no longer have to worry that stock prices might climb so high, or companies take on so much debt, that a financial crisis might ensue. In this world without trade-offs, we can shut down the fossil fuel industry and transition to a zero-carbon economy without any risk to employment and economic growth. Nor is there any amount of infrastructure investment that could possibly exceed the capacity of the construction industry to absorb it.,Rest assured that the economy won’t miss a beat no matter how high or fast the minimum wage is raised. And whatever benefits are required by the always-struggling middle class can be financed by raising taxes on big corporations and the undeserving rich.,So party on, progressive dudes. Worries about debt and inflation are just ,20th-century, the figments of a now-discredited neoliberal imagination. We have entered a magical world where borrowing is costless, spending pays for itself, stocks only rise and the dollar never falls. In this economic paradise, government mandarins can fine-tune the economy to prevent inflation and unemployment, while economic, racial, environmental and social justice can be achieved without any painful trade-offs.,Okay, I exaggerate — but only slightly. I’ll be the first to admit that because of new technology and structural changes to the global economy, aspects of our economic understanding need to be updated. But those overdue correctives have been hijacked by partisans and ideologues who would have us believe that the laws of economics have been repealed.,It is undoubtedly true, for example, that in a globalized economy, the United States is less susceptible to , capacity constraints or a crowding-out of private borrowing by government borrowing. But that doesn’t mean that the government can borrow and spend an extra $10 trillion on,, infrastructure and climate investments without running a serious risk of overheating the economy.,Similarly, although , that governments can safely run higher annual budget deficits than previously thought, it’s also true that even a modest run-up in interest rates in a country as indebted as ours would saddle taxpayers with economically and politically painful levels of debt service.,Since the financial crisis of 2008, the , that it could avert financial panic and global depression by printing dollars and using them to buy government and corporate bonds. But what we should also have learned is that running the printing press at full tilt for years after the initial crisis has passed creates giant credit and investment bubbles that will burst at the first hint that the bond-buying is about to end.,All this borrowing and money-printing also risks triggering a run on the dollar and demands from foreign investors for higher interest payments on the $1 trillion they lend us each year just to maintain our current standard of living. Just because these things haven’t happened yet doesn’t mean that they won’t. And when they do, the unwinding will be swift and painful.,Or consider the current debate about the minimum wage. A thorough,strongly suggests that a higher minimum wage can lift millions out of poverty while causing fewer job losses than economic theory would suggests. But what you never hear from supporters of a $15-an-hour minimum wage is where the money will come from to give hefty pay raises — as much as 100 percent — to 27 million American workers, 1 in every 6. While a bit may come from higher worker productivity, most of the tab will be paid for by consumers in the form of higher prices, fellow employees in the form of lower raises and business owners in the form of lower profits. This is not just redistribution of income from the top 1 percent — it’s also redistribution from everyone else.,There is nothing magic, by the way, about $15 — it’s nothing more than a stretch goal chosen by grass-roots labor organizers.,If our goal is to restore the minimum wage to the purchasing power it had during the golden years of the 1960s and 1970s, then the right number would be something closer to,.,Alternatively, we could peg the minimum wage to the level necessary to bring a full-time worker above the poverty line. In that case, the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 would do the trick for a single worker, or $11 if you think a single parent with two children is the right reference point.,Or perhaps we should adopt the , standard calculated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers, based on what it costs to provide the basic necessities enjoyed by most Americans. That would require a minimum wage ranging from $13 an hour for a single person to as high as $35 an hour in some states for a family of three.,My own preference would be to take our cue from the labor market and peg the minimum wage at half the hourly earnings of the median full-time worker, adjusted for regional variations. Nationally, that would average out to about $12.50 an hour, but would range from about $9 in a state such as Alabama to as high as $16 in California. Such a formula could win backing not just from a number of Republicans in Congress, but also from major business organizations. And yet if Democrats were offered the chance to pass such a deal tomorrow, it’s likely the pushback from progressives would be so loud that the White House and congressional leaders would turn it down.,The minimum wage, however, should not be considered in isolation. There is also broad bipartisan support for increasing and expanding the , — the government’s wage supplement for low-wage workers. And there is similar support for increases in the , and a refundable , When combined with food stamps and a fair minimum wage, these programs could effectively end poverty among working families in America.,My purpose in walking through this analysis is to point out that this is the kind of discussion that the country and Congress should be having at this moment — and that many of us hoped would happen with the arrival of a moderate, dealmaking president.,But what we have been treated to instead are mindless talking points (“Go Big”) politically inspired lines in the sand ($1.9 trillion in stimulus, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, $1,400 rebates) and transparently partisan proposals to reward the Democratic base, buy off White working-class voters and avenge the partisan outrages of the Trump era. Instead of bringing a polarized country together after a narrow election victory, Democrats seem determined to spike the football in the end zone.,It is disappointing, of course, that Democrats have embraced some of the same intellectual dishonesty, and the same all-or-nothing strategy, that they rightfully criticized when the Republicans were doing it. But what is equally disappointing is the performance my colleagues in the media, who relentlessly and heroically exposed the lies and exaggeration and false narratives of the Trump era but have suddenly lost their critical eye.,The extensive coverage of the $1.9 trillion relief package, for example, has been full of all the usual talking points and political posturing but has contained little about how these vast sums were arrived at or how the money would actually be distributed and spent.,Rare is the story these days that does not highlight how “progressives” feel about an issue, with nary a mention of what moderates or business leaders have to say.,Where is the three-, skepticism when the chair of the Federal Reserve assures that there is no connection between skyrocketing values for tech stocks and bitcoin and his pledge to continue pumping an additional $120 billion a month into the financial system?,And when was it decided that every economic issue or business practice is best viewed through the lens of race and gender?,Having written and edited my way through several of these economic and political cycles, I shouldn’t be surprised that the pendulum is now swinging too far in the other direction. But just as there is a danger in each new generation declaring that a new day has dawned and all the rules have changed, there is also a danger that those of the previous generation will fall into the trap of fighting the last war, offering up the same nostrums, and clinging too hard to outdated models of how the world works.,Back when I started at The Washington Post, there was a longtime reporter on the national desk who, whenever an editor would wander over to suggest he write a story about some issue in the news, would invariably reply, “We had it,” or “I already wrote that.”,In recent years, I’ve sometimes heard myself saying the same things to editors or readers who write in with a column suggestion. I find myself gravitating to the same topics, the same sources, even the same metaphors and sentence constructions. I’ve stubbornly declined to participate in social media, which for good or ill (mostly ill, I think) has now become an integral to the way journalists report what is happening, participate in the public conversation and let readers know what they’ve written.,These days my journalistic metabolism is better suited to a weekly magazine than the 24-7 news cycle, while my natural instinct to avoid writing about topics everyone else is writing about ignores the demanding realities of digital publishing. And in a polarized political and media environment, I am a reliable champion for neither tribe. It’s time to hang it up.,So this will be the last of my irregular columns for The Post. After 33 years, I’ve managed to outlast four executive editors, five managing editors and six business editors, and been lucky enough to work alongside hundreds of incredibly talented colleagues in a truly remarkable newsroom. I owe much to the countless economists, business and labor leaders, management consultants, politicians and public servants who have taken the time to tell me what they know and teach me about business and economics.,And it has been particularly satisfying to have been able to mentor so many young journalists who have gone on to become big stars in their own right. Most of all, it has been an honor and privilege to write for knowledgeable, discerning and appreciative readers who’ve never shied away from letting me know when I’ve gotten it wrong.,To all of you, thanks and farewell."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/18/tax-break-retirees-charitable-donations/,A tax break for retirees is back. Here’s how to use it — and what to avoid.,"Welcome to the height of tax prep season, with millions of people pressing to get their 2020 returns finished and filed.,But rather than talk about your 2020 taxes, let’s talk about a tax break for some of us that disappeared last year but is back in full force this year.,This break is a fringe benefit of getting old. It lets some of us (including me) in their 70s and up use a tax strategy that got canceled for 2020 because of covid but is now back with us.,I’m talking about qualified charitable distributions, which allow individual retirement account holders to divert some of their federally taxable required distributions to charity. That lets the IRA holders make donations and reduce their federally taxable income — while still letting them take the standard deduction on their federal tax returns.,QCDs, as they’re known, ,, when — thanks to Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law — the number of people itemizing deductions (including charitable contributions) began to fall sharply to the current 11 percent or so from the previous 31 percent, according to a table on the IRS statistics., on several occasions since I began using them myself three years ago. But this time around, I’d like to explain things in more detail. I’d also like to delve into some history and — with the aid of  Professor Christopher Hoyt, who teaches about taxation and retirement plans  at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School — explain the rationale behind some QCD rules that hadn’t made any sense to me.,As a bonus, I’ll also warn you about a potential problem Hoyt brought to my attention.,For those of us who qualify to make QCDs, they’re as close to a free tax lunch as you can get these days.,Let me explain.,Tax laws let people put tax-deductible dollars into “defined contribution” accounts such as IRAs, 401(k)s and 403(b)s. But when you reach the age of 72, you have to start taking federally taxable “required minimum distributions” from those accounts.,Those RMDs, as they’re known, make sense: You and your employer (if you had one) deducted the money that went into these accounts, so it seems fair for you to have to begin taking money out of those accounts and paying federal tax on it.,The size of your required distribution depends on your year-end retirement account balances and your age. For example, if you had $100,000 in your retirement accounts last Dec. 31 and you turn (or have turned) 75 this year, your RMD is about $4,370.,If you are 80, it’s about $5,350. At 85, $6,760. Those amounts are based on life expectancies, so the older you get, the bigger your required distribution gets.,(If you inherited a retirement account before 2020, you had to immediately begin taking taxable distributions regardless of your age and could start making QCDs when you turn 70-1/2. If you inherited it in 2020 or later, you generally have to empty the account within 10 years and pay tax on the proceeds, but you don’t have to take annual distributions.),Last year, QCDs ceased to be big tax savers because ,. You could still use QCDs to make contributions last year, but their big tax advantage — reducing your taxable income by offsetting distributions you were required to take — went into hibernation for the year.,But this year, required distributions have returned, and QCDs have got their tax mojo back.,QCDs exist because charitable groups lobbied for them. They were created — on a temporary basis — as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. QCDs became permanent in 2015 as part of the PATH — for Protect Americans from Tax Hikes — Act. One of the great legislative acronyms.,To make a QCD, you either cut a check from one of your IRAs to a charity, or else have your IRA administrator send you or the charity a check made out to the charity. You can make up to $100,000 of QCDs a year, but only to registered charities. You can’t send them to your own donor-advised fund.,You can make QCDs only from IRAs — not from 401(k)s or 403(b)s. I never understood why, but Hoyt told me it’s because Congress didn’t want to subject employer plans such as 401(k)s to even greater bookkeeping requirements than they already have.,You have to keep track of QCDs yourself. Your retirement plan administrators send tax forms — known as 1099-Rs — to the IRS showing your total distributions for the year. You or your tax preparer have to subtract those QCDs from your 1099-R income. The plan administrator doesn’t do that.,Why aren’t plan administrators required to put QCD numbers on your retirement income statements? Hoyt says that would require administrators to check every one of your QCDs to make sure it went to a registered 501(c) (3) charity. That would be a big, messy and expensive undertaking.,And now, to the problem, created — inadvertently — by the Secure Act of 2019, which allowed some people aged 70 ½ and up to make tax-deductible contributions to their IRAs.,The problem is that if you make tax-deductible contributions to an IRA that you’re using to make QCDs, it triggers a reduction in the amount of QCDs you’re allowed to deduct from your federally taxable income. It is, to use the technical tax term, a total hairball.,So if, like me, you’re making both QCDs and tax-deductible retirement account contributions, you’ve got to be careful not to trip over yourself.,Hoyt says the key is to make sure you’re not making QCDs from the same IRA into which you’re putting tax-deductible dollars. If, like me, you’re self-employed and have no employees, Hoyt says you can set up a solo 401(k) (which is what I’ve done) or a SEP-IRA and make deductible contributions to it. But, Hoyt warns, “avoid making QCDs from a SEP-IRA in the same year that you claimed an income tax deduction for contributing to the SEP-IRA."",Tax season isn’t fun. But if you’re part of the QCD world, next year’s tax season should be less painful than this year’s, because you’ll be able to see the benefit you got from making donations to charities you care about. That strikes me as a pretty nice deal."

It became a large-scale business, attracting boldface-name investors including Ted Leonsis and Steve Case.,Custom Ink encourages customers to go online and design T-shirts honoring family reunions, milestone events, businesses, philanthropies, sports teams, religious groups and more. Think 50 T-shirts emblazoned with “The Smith Family Reunion” or 150 baseball caps for the local 5K.,Then the , crisis hit in March 2020 and sales slid 80 percent within days. Like thousands of U.S. businesses slammed by virus shutdowns, Custom Ink had to figure out how to survive. It was forced to recalibrate and rethink its business as the pandemic took the world to a different place.,It was an especially difficult time for the business, which has shipped more than 125 million T-shirts. “Our business is driving social togetherness, family outings, school activities and occasions,” Katz said in a recent interview. “That hit a hard stop with social distancing. We had a huge challenge that was aimed at the heart of the business.”,In a note to his staff — known as Inkers — after the pandemic hit, Katz acknowledged the precipitous drop in sales and that the situation could not go on much longer.,“This is the email I’ve been dreading to write . . . and I’m sure you’ve been dreading to read,” he wrote. He warned that the company might need to “take major action both inside the company and with our investors and lenders to ensure we stay in business” and raised the specter of furloughs and dramatic cost-cutting.,Within days, Custom Ink furloughed around 75 percent of its 1,700 employees for at least two months. Senior leadership saw significant pay reductions.,It continued paying health insurance premiums for its furloughed team members, he said, and helped employees apply for unemployment benefits and access their retirement savings to see them through the crisis. Katz also offered interest-free advances and set up a hotline for employees.,“We tried to do the furlough as compassionately as possible,” Katz said.,That left the company with a skeleton staff to keep it going.,“There were so many questions about what’s going to happen in the economy and the world,” Katz said recently. “We had just seen our sales fall 80 percent in a week and a half. A week and a half!”,Except for the T-shirt printing teams in facilities in Nevada and Charlottesville, the company went virtual overnight. Complex functions ranging from marketing to customer service migrated out of its Fairfax, Va., headquarters and into employee homes.,Production facilities had to be supplied with safety gear. Protocols had to be instituted. Vendors had to be notified.,With the news filled with reports of medical shortages, especially N95 masks, Inkers had an idea — sell cloth masks to reduce the demand for medical-grade supplies.,Katz loved it. He had just read an interview with a Chinese researcher who promoted masks as a way to stop the spread of the coronavirus. At the same time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encouraged Americans to use cloth masks as a way to preserve the N95 masks for health-care workers.,“It sounds obvious now, but it wasn’t at the time,” Katz said. “We were ahead of the CDC. We lined up the first model of our mask, and by the time the CDC gave guidance, we already had the mask project going.”,Custom Ink took its T-shirt supply chain and turned it into a national distribution system for cloth masks. Tech teams worked round-the-clock to update the company’s site and fulfillment systems and sales. Marketing teams mobilized to offer new products to create revenue.,Every pandemic-related sales idea was on the table. Custom Ink sold work-from-home kits so client companies could help remote employees feel connected. They invented drive-by graduation gear for schools to share. Charitable T-shirt campaigns were updated to include a focus on the pandemic.,Katz said the company had to temporarily scrap its traditional marketing, which had been built around people throwing their arms around one another. “We adapted our marketing to new environments and to the safety messages people were consuming during the pandemic,” he said.,Custom Ink was soon delivering millions of cloth masks, with prices from $1 for a plain mask up to $8 for special designs.,Katz’s team made it so customers could go online and spice up their mask with colors, designs and logos. Custom Ink refined its products as it went, altering the masks for comfort, fit and style.,The marketing and technology teams built a free-standing “Mask for It” store to allow customers to express their personalities through their face coverings.,Katz declined to divulge hard numbers on mask sales, but he said they helped bridge the financial gap from the shutdown-related collapse in March to the gradual return of the core business over the spring and summer.,Over time, buyers shifted from generic cloth masks to custom masks with special colors and designs. Those went from a small fraction of unit sales in April 2020 to the majority of mask sales by midsummer, according to the company.,Mask revenue helped the company bring back its employees in August. Custom Ink is back to 1,600 Inkers.,“We lost about 10 percent of our team along the way because people moved to be closer to family,” Katz said. “The vast majority stuck with us.”,The company finished 2020 only slightly behind its original sales goals.,“It’s not as much as we otherwise would have made, but we turned a profit,” Katz said. “We were very determined to see the company through this, and we ultimately did.”,

The Bears lost the final in 1948 to Kentucky.,?,So it will be Cinderella — No. 11 seed UCLA, which won the most recent of its titles in 1995 — against three high seeds, each seeking a first national championship.,Nothing happened this week to change the minds of those who have thought since December that Gonzaga and Baylor ,. The two schools were supposed to play in Indianapolis on Dec. 5, but the game was called off a couple of hours before tip-off after positive tests involving two members of the Gonzaga traveling party.,Gonzaga Coach Mark Few and Baylor Coach Scott Drew insisted at the time that they would do everything they could to reschedule.,“We’ll find a way to play it at some point.” ,. “We’ll make it happen.”,They are now each one win away from doing so, but with a national championship at stake.,Gonzaga has been the most impressive team in the country all season.

The conference, touted by many as one of the great conferences of all time during the regular season, got nine bids — including two No. 1 seeds, Michigan and Illinois, and two No. 2 seeds, Iowa and Ohio State.,All of that led to an embarrassing 8-9 record in tournament games, with only Michigan even making the second weekend. So much for Big Ten hype.,The other often-hyped conference, the ACC, got seven bids, but none higher than Florida State and Virginia, both No. 4 seeds. Duke , — for the first time since 1995.

State wasn’t supposed to have any chance against Houston in 1983, and Villanova was supposed to be fodder for Georgetown two years later. In 1976, undefeated Indiana trailed Michigan at halftime in the championship game and came back to win by 18.,As Bob Knight walked out of the Spectrum in Philadelphia that night with Bob Hammel, the sports editor of the Bloomington newspaper, Hammel said: “You did it Bob! You did it!”,Knight shrugged and, thinking back to his 31-1 team a year earlier, said, “Should have been two.”,If Few can walk out of Lucas Oil Stadium on Monday night having matched the accomplishment of that Indiana team of 45 years ago, you can be sure he’ll be very happy to have one."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/sports-fans-live-attendance-poll/,Post-UMD poll: Fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable attending sports in person,"As Major League Baseball opens its new season under a lingering coronavirus cloud and NBA and NHL teams begin making a final push for the playoffs, fewer than half of Americans say they would feel comfortable attending a live sporting,event, according to a ,.,Baseball’s Opening Day is Thursday, and stadiums across the country will open their gates and welcome back fans with a range of restrictions and protocols in place, including mask mandates and caps on attendance. While 42 percent of Americans are comfortable attending a live, ticketed sporting event in general — compared with 40 percent who are not and 18 percent who are unsure — people say their own comfort levels vary widely based on conditions.,About two-thirds say they would feel comfortable attending an outdoor event such as baseball (66 percent), but fewer than half as many (32 percent) feel comfortable attending an indoor event such as basketball. Nearly 2 in 3 people (64 percent) say they would feel comfortable if all attendees were required to wear masks, compared with 22 percent who would feel comfortable if there was no mask requirement.,In the poll, 63 percent of Americans say it is a large or moderate risk to attend a sporting event right now, including 26 percent who say it’s a large risk. That marks a sharp decline in risk over the past year: In a ,, 84 percent said attending a sporting event was a large or moderate risk, including 65 percent who said it was a “large risk.”,The Post-U.-Md. poll was conducted from March 12 to 18, as coronavirus infection rates started to plateau and vaccinations increased across the country. It was done online and included a random sample of 1,500 adult Americans, carrying a margin of error of plus or minus three points. The survey was conducted in collaboration with the University of Maryland’s Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and its Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.,Basketball and hockey teams have adjusted their attendance policies regularly in recent weeks as local conditions and restrictions have changed. Ten NBA and 15 NHL teams still don’t allow any spectators, though more are beginning to open their doors to limited crowds. Baseball is poised to begin its season with fans permitted in all 30 stadiums. After staging its entire 2020 regular season in empty ballparks, capacity limits this spring will range from 12 percent (Boston Red Sox) to 100 percent (Texas Rangers).,“Opening Day with fans in there is definitely going to be sick,” Manny Machado, the San Diego Padres all-star, said on a recent Zoom call with reporters. “It’s going to be awesome. I know everybody in here definitely can’t wait. I’ve been pumping it up. I’ve been saying it’s going to be the loudest 12- to 14,000, however many fans we have. … I’m getting goose bumps right now just thinking about it.”,To Americans, circumstances matter a great deal: They say outdoor events, mask requirements, strict attendance limits and personal vaccinations would make them feel more open to returning to stadiums.,More say they would be comfortable attending a stadium limited to 20 percent capacity (69 percent “comfortable”) than 50 percent capacity (50 percent). The vast majority of teams will open the season with seating capacity limits in the 15 percent to 30 percent range, which often means fewer than 10,000 fans will be on hand.,“You always want as many fans as possible,” Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer said. “I love it when it’s sold out and the crowd’s rocking. Obviously, I get why we’re not going to have sold-out crowds. I get it. But, yeah, the more fans we can have, the better.”,Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this week that masks should be mandatory at all games and urged teams to space out fans. But he said teams should base many protocols, such as permissible crowd size, on local conditions.,“It’s nice to think that we have a mathematical precision in figuring out what the right number is, but it’s just not true,” he said. “It really depends a lot on the level of infection in the community where the ballpark is located. You’re going to assume that the overwhelming majority of people that are going to show up at the ballpark are from the area where the ballpark is located.”,In the Post-U.-Md. poll, 54 percent of Americans say they’re comfortable attending sporting events if coronavirus case levels are low in the event’s region.,The Rangers are the only MLB team beginning the season at full capacity, as they look to show off their 40,000-seat new home. Globe Life Field opened last season in Arlington, Tex., without fans in attendance, which Texas Manager Chris Woodward likened to having “a brand-new car for a year that you couldn’t get out of the garage.”,Mask requirements at sporting events enjoy wide support, with roughly three-quarters of Americans overall and sports fans alike saying sports leagues should require attendees to wear them. However, that support dips to 56 percent among people who are currently comfortable attending live sports events. There is also a sharp partisan divide on the issue with 96 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents supporting a mask mandate at games, compared with 52 percent support from Republicans and Republican leaners.,Just as teams in different cities implement different protocols, fan sentiments vary by region, too. Americans in the Midwest are most comfortable attending a live sporting event (47 percent), compared with 42 percent in the South and in the West and 34 percent in the Northeast.,Still, just about,1 in 3 in the Midwest say they would be comfortable attending an indoor sporting event, half the share that would be comfortable at an outdoor one.,NBA and NHL teams have been hesitant to invite large groups to their games. Some cap attendance at 10 percent, which typically amounts to just a few thousand fans.,“It’s nice to have them, but you really don’t hear them much,” said Washington Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, whose team sees spectators only on the road. “ … It’s great to have fans. Even if it’s only 2,000, it’s better than nothing.”,Those teams are still sorting out appropriate protocols. For example, any ticket holder attending a Brooklyn Nets game is mailed a PCR test in advance and receives a rapid result on-site before allowed entry into Barclays Center. And as baseball opens its season, the New York Yankees and New York Mets are requiring proof of full vaccination or a negative coronavirus test before letting any fan into their stadium.,In the Post-U.-Md. poll, 56 percent of Americans say they’re comfortable attending live sporting events if attendees provide a negative coronavirus test, and nearly two-thirds of Americans say they would feel comfortable going to a sporting event after they have received a vaccine.,That dynamic hasn’t played out among Americans who have already received at least one dose, though. The poll finds Americans who have been vaccinated are more likely to feel uncomfortable attending at this time than unvaccinated adults, a pattern that may reflect the fact that vaccinated Americans are older and still express,concern about family members catching the coronavirus."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/nationals-starting-rotation-scherzer-strasburg-corbin/,The starting rotation remains Washington’s foundation — and its greatest hope,"Every season since 2012, without exception, the fate of the Washington Nationals has been defined by the excellence, or the miseries, of its rotation. Those men are the team’s identity and most of its payroll, too.,Just one month ago, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin, Jon Lester and Joe Ross all looked like they might be the worst-case versions of themselves when the Nats opened their season Thursday night at home against the New York Mets.,Scherzer had just ,. Strasburg was coming back ,. Lester was, suddenly, ,. Ross was an unknown ,. Corbin was , last year.,Oh, brother.,With the Nats facing a brutal schedule over the season’s first six weeks, 2021 might be DOA in May. No wonder oddsmakers ranked the Nats only slightly above the middle of the MLB pack. After all, Washington’s rotation was next-to-, in ERA in the National League last year.,With pitchers in spring, as you ramp up from almost leisurely side sessions to 90-plus empty-the-tank pitches, things can change very quickly. It’s a danger zone. Some core staff members don’t survive that return to full-force pitching and are lost for months, or the year.,But some teams, with fingers crossed all the way, get to April with exactly the rotation they wanted, all in good health and throwing like the best versions of themselves that you could reasonably expect.,Right now, that’s the Nats. At least for one day. If nobody trips on a dugout steps during introductions.,Every pitcher comes with an “if.” Before April ends, the Nats’ starters’ ERA might be headed to infinity and beyond. After all, last year’s 5.38 mark was unspeakable.,Also, the season’s first three series — against the Mets, the three-time division champion Atlanta Braves and the , — would test any staff, much less one like the Nats that has only jelled recently.,But right now, I am anxious to see this rotation pitch — not in the sense of anxiety, but with anticipation. Yes, all five of them — Lester and Ross, too, about whom we will get big chunks of the truth very quickly in April.,How did all this happen and so quickly?,Early in training camp, Scherzer sprained his ankle, which set back his normal throwing program. For 36-year-old pitchers, that can be a red flag. Was he showing his age? Was he wise to push through discomfort and come back quickly?,The Mad Max approach worked. Scherzer’s recent starts have been decent, if less than dominant, and , — in a backfield game — got him near 100 pitches, with the last reportedly at 95 mph with a grunt.,At the start of camp, Strasburg was also lightly used because he was still , wrist surgery which ended his 2020 season after only two games. Docs said fixing carpal tunnel syndrome should be routine. But Strasburg and surgery are two words that don’t rhyme.,On Sunday and Monday, MASN finally deigned to televise the Nationals’ last two exhibition games of the spring. But they were instructive. Strasburg threw 98 pitches on Monday and, in his last two innings, found his mechanics and command, which had been rusty, and fanned the last three hitters he faced.,Since Strasburg had 83 pitches in his previous start, this key man, who might have been limited for weeks, is instead ready for full-go on Day One.,Perhaps the worst shock of early camp was news that Lester, ,, had such problems with low energy that he needed surgery to have a parathyroid gland removed. How long would that knock him out? Answer: ,.,Veteran lefties with elite pedigrees, as they lose velocity, sometimes adapt and become valuable back-end starters for a few years. So far, Lester looks much better than last year’s version of Aníbal Sánchez (6.62 ERA) and capable of a crafty, twice-through-the-order role, at the least.,The bigger question: After years of using 75-to-80 percent fastballs and cutters, can Lester adapt (like late career Tom Glavine, for example) to 40-to-45 percent off-speed pitches — in Lester’s case, curves and change-ups. If it works, he’s a steal at $5 million. If not, he still may be durable, gritty and a .500 pitcher.,Ross, after a very promising 12-10, 3.52 ERA start in his first two seasons, has been a mystery of major injury (,) and minor flaws, especially an inability to command more than his sinker and slider. In his last sharp outing, Ross used four pitches, including a change, touched 95 in his last inning and had 69 percent strikes. Don’t hold your breath, but this time … maybe.,Corbin in his last outing had the repertoire of the 2019 World Series season, though perhaps not quite as crisp. His fastball sat at 92-93, plus his usual wipeout slider, more change-ups and, in tune with the times, more top-of-zone challenge pitches, a tactic about which Max has been whispering in his ear.,Has the Nats rotation hits its form at the right time? Or is a steady diet of Mets, Braves, Dodgers and Cards about to hit them in the face for weeks on end? Get ready, because we’re probably going to find out a lot in a hurry.,In 2012, ’14, ’16, ‘17 and ’19, when the Nats won four NL East titles and a World Series, their starters finished first, first, second, third and second in NL ERA. In their other, poorer years, they were sixth, sixth, ninth and 14th.,Then, as now, several bullpens caused worry. But 'pens can be amended, and mended, in season. Rotations usually can’t. Also, this year, Erick Fedde and Austin Voth offer a bit of decent depth, plus bullpen usefulness, which will be needed, and tested, ,.,Washington has had , of post-world-championship celebration. Except for , almost exactly 17 months ago, there hasn’t really been one.,Last year was so blighted by the pandemic, and the Nats’ bad play, that much of MLB has forgotten how good the Nats were over the previous eight years. My hope for this year — in addition to playing all 162 games — is that the Nats give a decent account of themselves, worthy of the 2019 team, one that shows last year was a fluke.,That way, D.C. fans could, in steadily increasing numbers, go to Nats Park and enjoy the same kind of competitive, contending team that the Lerner family and GM Mike Rizo have built so consistently.,Right now, few around MLB predict such a thing. Vegas says third place, 84.5 wins and no playoffs. A month ago, I might have agreed. Now, I want the over.,The Nats are many things, but always “rotation first.” In 2019, Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin , the first NL trio in 50 years to have 200 strikeouts each. Last year, they were 7-12 with a 4.43 ERA — a bunch of bums.,Many in MLB have written them off as a force. I don’t think the Big Three have evaporated at ages 36, 32 and 31. Stat projection sites — which only know the facts of their careers, not their names — say they will combined for 600 strikeouts this year. Lester and Ross look like upgrades behind them. Fedde, plus Voth offer reasonable depth.,Optimism is ,. But this time, though with normal April stomach flutters, it seems justified for the Nationals."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/brenda-frese-ap-coach-of-the-year/,Maryland’s Brenda Frese named AP national coach of the year,"SAN ANTONIO — Brenda Frese was about to sit down during an NCAA tournament film session when her parents, Bill and Donna, unexpectedly popped up on the screen. The woman who loves to surprise others was about to get one herself.,Bill took the lead and said they never really got a chance to say congratulations for winning Big Ten coach of the year and the national honor from ESPN. However, he wanted to be the first to say congrats for being named AP national coach of year — as the team erupted in applause and Donna clapped and shook both hands in the air.,“We’re so darn proud of you,” Bill said on the AP produced video. “Almost makes you have tears in your eyes.”,The Maryland women’s basketball coach earned the honor for the second time after leading the Terrapins to a 26-3 record and the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. She is just the fourth coach to win the award multiple times since its inception in 1995, joining UConn’s Geno Auriemma, Baylor’s Kim Mulkey and Notre Dame’s Muffet McGraw.,“An incredible surprise,” Frese said. “Family is so important for me. So, to pull off that surprise to have my parents share that with me. My entire family was on the Zoom. I was with my entire Maryland family, as well. You couldn’t have scripted that any more perfectly.,“I didn’t make a basket all year. This award is about your players and your team and your support staff really lining up as one.”,Maryland entered the 2020-21 season without its five starters from the 2019-20 Big Ten championship team and without five of its top six scorers. With five new starters, including two sophomores and two transfers, the Terps won the conference championship for the sixth time in seven years and Big Ten tournament title for the second year in a row. The team was the highest scoring team in the nation and set a program record averaging 90.8 points per game.,Frese became the , this season and surpassed 500 wins at the helm of Maryland. She has a 512-131 record and was , for the fourth time this season.,Frese also coached the season with a heavy heart as Bill continues to deal, in recent months.,Maryland entered the tournament as a No. 2 seed and the, to No. 6-seeded Texas. The Terps had won their previous 15 games, including five postseason games, by double digits. Maryland won its three Big Ten Tournament games by an average of 21 points and its first two NCAA tournament games by an average of 44.5 points.,“This one, obviously, is special for our team and for our program,” Frese said, “just because of everything we had to overcome as a team and obviously during this pandemic. I have just so much gratitude for an award like this because it’s not an award for me. It’s an award for your players and your staff.,“It was a season like no other. You look at the challenges. The fact that you couldn’t do it like you normally can. I’ve yet to have the team out to my home. You couldn’t do team building. … This sisterhood, this bond was created early over Zoom, ironically. … I think it speaks volumes to this team, just their talent level.”,Svrluga: "
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/anthony-fauci-sports-stadiums-fans/,"For Anthony S. Fauci, going to a ballgame is ‘the one fun thing I can’t wait to do’",": There were no fans allowed at baseball games last year during the regular season, but a lot has changed since then. Are you comfortable with spectators attending games in person right now?,: I think that what we’re going to be seeing as the season progresses and as we get more and more people vaccinated and the level of infection comes down in the community, there will be more flexibility in getting more and more people into the ballpark. Hopefully by the time we get in the full swing of the season, there’ll be a lot more people that could feel comfortable being in the ballpark. I mean, obviously, there will still be the masking requirement. There will still be spaced seating.,One of the things we have going in our favor is that every day we vaccinate in this country, close to 3 million people every single day. And the more people that get vaccinated, the less likely it is that you’re going to have an issue. Now, obviously, we are still concerned that the rate of infection in the country is still quite high. It’s still plateaued now at somewhere between [55,000] and 65,000 new infections per day, which is quite high.,However, if we continue to implement the public health measures that we talk about all the time — the wearing of masks, the avoiding congregate settings, particularly indoors, the washing of hands — and as more and more people get vaccinated, I think there’s going to be more and more flexibility and greater attendance at places like [Nationals Park].,: To start, the Washington Nationals are among the teams that will have only a few thousand people allowed in attendance —,: Whatever they start off with, I think it’s going to get better and better as we get into the season. And then hopefully by the time we’re into the season, we’ll even have a great deal of flexibility and more and more people.,: A recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found 2 in 3 Americans say they’re comfortable attending an outdoor event such as baseball, but fewer than half say they’re comfortable going to an indoor event such as basketball. Is it safe to assume those concerns are warranted?,: There’s a big difference between indoor and outdoor. We know that from experience that when you’re in a place like [Nationals Park] and particularly if you’re well spaced and you’re seating and you’re wearing a mask, the chance of spreading infection is extraordinarily low. Outdoor is clearly far, far safer than indoors because of the recirculation of air indoors. Whereas outdoor, you know, you have a dilution with the entire environment, so that’s why the risk is so much lower in an outdoor [setting]. That’s why stadiums like [Nationals Park], if you have an appropriate, prudent spacing of people, the risk is very low.,: In the poll, 64 percent of people said they would be comfortable attending if everyone was required to wear a mask. Even at outdoor events with spacing in the stands, do you think masks should be considered mandatory?,: Yeah.,: Baseball stadiums will have a wide range of attendance capacities — from 12 to 100 percent, with many closer to 20 to 25 percent. Is there a magic number?,: It’s nice to think that we have a mathematical precision in figuring out what the right number is, but it’s just not true. It really depends a lot on the level of infection in the community where the ballpark is located. You’re going to assume that the overwhelming majority of people that are going to show up at the ballpark are from the area where the ballpark is located.,The judgment of what percentage of capacity you’re going to have is likely going to be influenced by what the level of baseline infection is in the community surrounding and the geographic area of the ballpark.,: It stands to reason that baseline number will be different everywhere, so we will see different attendance limits throughout the season. But one team is opening the season at 100 percent capacity. What do you make of that?,: What team is that?,: The Texas Rangers in Arlington.,: Really? Well, that’s interesting. I don’t want to be critical of that, but that’s — I would not start off with 100 percent capacity. But, you know, Texas has been always a bit more — what’s the right word? — daring when it comes to the kinds of things that they want to do in regards to this outbreak.,: On the other end of the spectrum, the New York Yankees and New York Mets are requiring proof of a full vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for every ticket holder. Should that be mandatory?,: I don’t really want to pass judgment, because then I get pitted against entire organizations. So, I mean, everybody has their own way of doing things. One of the ways is to require a negative test or proof of vaccination. I’m not saying that’s a bad idea, but it’s going to vary. As you said, some ballparks are allowing 100 percent capacity. Some want to start off at 10 to 20 percent capacity. And because everybody does things independently, you’re going to have a great variety of requirements that people are going to have. And one of them might be a negative test and proof of vaccination.,: You mentioned the importance of people maintaining their distance. Many teams are offering only cashless transactions at concession stands. Does that feel necessary to you?,: That’s a creative way. Any way you can diminish personal interaction with someone that’s not a member of your own family, I think, would be a step toward more safety. So anything that’s creative, including — because we know that when people go to the concession stands, that’s when people are close and that’s where the risk increases. So anything that can minimize the risk in that environment, I think, would be a positive.,: The baseball season is obviously long. How do you see stadium restrictions evolving in the coming months?,: I hope that as we get into the late spring, early summer, that we get more people vaccinated. Every day you’re going to get up to 3 million people in this country vaccinated. The more people that get vaccinated, the safer it is for everyone. I would hope that as we get into the late spring and early summer that you’re going to have a lot more flexibility on people in the stands.,: The NBA and NHL playoffs will get going before summer — May and June. Is it possible those will be safer to attend in person?,: It’s going to really depend on the level of infection in the community. That really is the determining factor. If the infection numbers go way down as more people get vaccinated, there can be more flexibility indoors.,: What about you? We’ve all heard about your affinity for the sport — will you be attending a baseball game any time soon?,: My life has just been completely dominated by response to this outbreak, but if you’re asking me what’s the one fun thing I can’t wait to do, it’s to go to [Nationals Park] and watch the team.,: You went last year. Are you eager to have a do-over at the first pitch?,: I don’t know about that. But I certainly am going to be rooting for them, that’s for sure.,: So no first-pitch plans?,: Not right now."

The two new lawsuits , over allegations of acting improperly with them during massage sessions to 21.,Watson has steadfastly denied acting inappropriately with women as allegations have mounted since the first lawsuits were filed in mid-March. On Wednesday, his attorney, Rusty Hardin, released the statements of 18 massage therapists who, he claimed, voiced support for Watson, and said the NFL star never acted improperly with them.,“I never had any problem with him and I never heard anyone say anything bad about Deshaun,” read one such statement from Ana Campion, a licensed massage therapist in Houston who said she had massaged Watson several times from 2017 through last year.,Watson has not been charged with a crime over these allegations, and it’s unclear if any law enforcement agency in Texas has opened an investigation. Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the accusers, initially claimed he would deliver evidence to the Houston Police Department to help spur a criminal investigation. However, on late Tuesday night Buzbee wrote on Instagram that he and his clients had decided not to cooperate with Houston police because Thomas Hardin, the son of Watson’s attorney, is a member of the force.,“I support his service, along with all Houston police officers,” Buzbee wrote. “But … me and my clients will go elsewhere to provide our evidence to investigative authorities.”,The NFL, which has broad authority to punish players even if alleged activity does not result in criminal charges, is also investigating the accusations against Watson."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/nationals-defense-josh-bell-starlin-castro/,These Nationals have plenty of strengths — and at least one glaring weakness,"Opening Day is virtually synonymous ,. But man, am I worried about the Washington Nationals’ defense.,There is so much to like about what the Nationals ,, identifying their holes early and aggressively moving to fill them, a signature of ,, now entering its 13th season. They needed to lengthen the lineup to provide more threats than just Juan Soto and Trea Turner, so , and the , made perfect sense. They needed another veteran starter after the departure of Aníbal Sánchez, so ,. With Sean Doolittle’s ,, they needed a left-hander in the bullpen, preferably one who could close, so they welcomed Brad Hand, ,.,Check, check, check, check. There was solid logic behind each move.,And yet, when the Nationals take the field Thursday night at Nationals Park to open the season — in front of , — they will need at least 27 outs to beat the New York Mets. I shudder at how many times this team might give the opponent 29 outs. Or 30. Or more.,You can win a single baseball game that way, washing away defensive lapses with offensive outbreaks or overpowering pitching. But over the course of a season — which, thankfully, will be , this year — those extra outs add up and wear you down.,“We got to get 27 quick outs,” Manager Dave Martinez said earlier in spring training. “We talk about it all the time. We can’t give these teams 28, 29, 30 outs, because if that happens, some of these [National League East] ,. We got to make sure to limit our mistakes.”,A sound philosophy — but a limited roster. Look around the field and identify a position at which the Nationals have an above-average defender., ,? Athletically, he has the range and the arm strength — yet he’s coming off a shortened 60-game season in which he was sloppy on defense, which had him saying this headed into spring training: “Obviously, the defense, I’d want to work on.”,Victor Robles in center? Again, the speed and range are there. But he played the 2020 season with a body that had bulked up too much, and instead of being fluid he was stiff. Metrics will tell you ,, not above, and while he has the ability to change that, he has to do it across the course of this summer.,And then … uh, no. There isn’t even another candidate. Soto is moving to right field full-time for the first time in the majors, so while the club can be optimistic, there’s a definite TBD factor there. Starlin Castro will , than the man he beat out for the job, ,, but in his long career, he has played more than 7,400 innings at shortstop and more than 4,900 at second base — but just 366⅔ at third. Anthony Rendon he is not.,Josh Harrison is on this team , — he can play second, third, left or right. But Kieboom’s struggles and subsequent start at Washington’s alternate site leave Harrison as the most frequent second baseman. That’s fine on a given night, middling over the course of a year. Of the 21 players who have logged at least 2,500 innings at second base over the past five seasons, Harrison is in the middle of FanGraphs’ defensive runs above average metric — 12th. Same for catcher Yan Gomes over that time period with that same minimum of innings — 15th of 29.,Schwarber was a catcher in college who learned to play the outfield as a pro, and he’s actually better than you think — 12th of 34 left fielders with more than 1,000 innings played over the past four years. Martinez, who helped teach Schwarber outfield play when both were with the Chicago Cubs, believes Schwarber is underrated in how quickly he gets to balls and how good his arm is when he gets there — and the metrics back him up. He’s not going to win a Gold Glove, but he won’t kill you out there.,But let’s get to the real problem: Bell. With six homers and a whopping 1.328 on-base-plus-slugging percentage this spring, , to provide more thump behind the wunderkind Soto. But to be effective for the 2021 Nats, he might have to adopt the philosophy of former Washington slugger/sage Adam Dunn: drive in more than you let in.,Bell is a candidate to be the worst defensive first baseman in the game. A strong candidate. Embrace that knowledge now, before you expect more from him. The , — and damning.,Of the 32 first basemen who have played at least 1,500 innings at the position since 2017, Bell ranks 30th in defensive runs saved (DRS), a metric originally developed by John Dewan of “The Fielding Bible,” which measures how much a player is above or below average at a specific position. Unfortunately, DRS is where Bell rates ,.,In ultimate zone rating (UZR), which attempts to calculate how many runs a player saves or costs his team, Bell ranks 32nd at minus-18.2. That’s bad. What’s worse: The next-worst first baseman over those four seasons is Houston’s Yuli Gurriel at minus-6.6. (By contrast, Oakland’s Matt Olson leads the majors at 21.4 in that span.) In the defensive runs above average metric, which makes it easier to compare defensive contributions across positions, Bell is also 32nd by a mile: minus-50.9, while no one else is worse than minus-40.4.,So Bell is the Mike Trout of poor defensive first basemen — an outlier. The situation is such that when the Nats lead late in games, veteran Ryan Zimmerman will be the defensive replacement. Zim can still pick it, and he ,. But when they X-ray his right shoulder these days, what’s revealed is sawdust and glue. Washington’s better defensive option is a guy who physically has trouble throwing.,The potential problem with a leaky defense as a weakness is it’s tied directly to what’s supposed to be Washington’s strength. This is a team that is built on its starting pitching — on preventing runs.,So here’s the scenario I can’t shake: There are two outs in the sixth. Max Scherzer uncorks his 90th pitch. The hitter makes contact. Pick an outcome: It falls just in front of Soto in right. It’s an easy grounder, but Bell can’t scoop out a throw in the dirt. It barely eludes Castro or Harrison. It sends Turner into the hole at short, but he doesn’t trust Bell enough to leap and unleash a laser across the infield, so he eats it.,None of those are errors. All result in Scherzer — or Stephen Strasburg, or Patrick Corbin, or Lester — to push 100 pitches or more to escape the frame. They impact the bullpen usage and the outcome on a given night, which affects who’s available the next night, which has an impact that builds — and wears — on a team over the course of months.,Get excited for this season, because the characters the Nationals have assembled have personality and pop. But in firing yourself up, be aware of the team’s deficiencies on defense, because they’re real. Then give thanks for those nights when all the Nats grant the other team is the 27 outs needed to win."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/william-jackson-fit-washington-defense/,How new cornerback William Jackson III fits into Washington’s defense,"The Washington Football Team’s search for cornerback depth escalated to an urgent need this offseason when Ronald Darby agreed to a three-year, $30 million contract with the Denver Broncos. Already thin in the secondary, Washington was suddenly down to one starting cornerback with few obvious options in an inflated free agent market.,But Washington quickly addressed the position by ,, and the move could prove to be one of its most impactful of the offseason.,“Not enough people know about him because he played in Cincinnati,” former Washington safety and current ESPN analyst Ryan Clark said. “Cincinnati stinks. When you look at a team and they’re not good, you’re not necessarily looking at the individual pieces for what they’re doing.”,With speed (4.37-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine), size (6-foot, 196 pounds) and ball skills, Jackson has the physical tools coveted at the position. His career numbers (only three interceptions in 59 games) fail to depict an elite cornerback, but they also fail to tell the whole story. He was targeted in coverage on only 14.1 percent of pass plays over the past three years, the fourth-lowest rate among starting cornerbacks who played at least 2,000 snaps in that span.,“I just tell them to watch the tape,” Jackson said. “I wasn’t getting thrown at a whole lot. … When you’re covering guys up, you don’t get many picks.”,Clark said he believes Jackson is on the cusp of becoming more of a household name, and Washington’s defense, led by its talented line, could help him get there. Washington jumped from the bottom five to the top five in most major categories in coordinator Jack Del Rio’s first season with the team.,“Every cornerback that has played under [Del Rio] has had successful years,” Jackson said. “He’s a coach that knows exactly what he’s doing. Every corner succeeds in his defense. I’m just here to succeed and make it better.”,Just how will Jackson fit in Del Rio’s 4-3 scheme?,With the Bengals, Jackson played primarily press-man coverage, sticking to opponents’ No. 1 receivers much as he did against Terry McLaurin in Washington’s win over Cincinnati last year. The Bengals, ,, played man coverage, or cover-one with a single-high safety, at the eighth-highest rate in the league. Washington, by comparison, was in man coverage only 21 percent of the time, 21st most in the NFL.,That Del Rio used more zone than man has led some to ask whether Jackson will face a challenge in transitioning to the scheme or whether Del Rio might make alterations to it based on Jackson’s arrival.,But the notion of “fit,” especially for defensive backs, requires context. NFL defenses, no matter the scheme, run a mix of man and zone, often in the same play. When Wade Phillips was defensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos, he described his team’s coverage as a “matchup zone” because it used both man and zone coverage simultaneously.,“We say, ‘Hey, you’re playing this zone, but when a guy comes over there, you match with him,’ ” ,. “ ‘You pass it off, just like in basketball. When another guy comes there, you go there.’ We play a lot of match zone, but people think we’re playing man-to-man. Hopefully that confuses them.”,Washington employed similar tactics last year, not just with its scheme but also the technique of its cornerbacks.,Take Washington’s ,, when Kendall Fuller intercepted Jared Goff in the second quarter. Before the snap, Washington appeared to be in man coverage but was actually in a cover-two scheme. Fuller lined up wide, across from wide receiver Cooper Kupp. When Kupp began his route inside, Fuller turned his head as if he planned to follow, then quickly turned to the quarterback and sunk back in coverage between Kupp and the slot receiver, where he made the interception.,It’s plausible Del Rio could tweak his playbook to capitalize on Jackson’s strengths as a press-man cornerback, though neither he nor anyone else in Washington has indicated that. If anything, Jackson’s abilities give the team more options and versatility in the defensive backfield.,Although Fuller was used primarily outside last season, he has played all over the secondary in his career. So, too, has cornerback Darryl Roberts, , who last played in Detroit. The addition of Jackson could free up both to move around to the slot, outside or even free safety in certain coverages.,“Where you sometimes lose the value of a player is when you say, 'Okay, we’re paying him this, so we’re going to make him do all of these things,’ ” Clark said. “Nah, the thing that made you pay him, you should probably let him do that as much as you possibly can. … Let [Jackson] play corner. Let him follow the number one [receiver] if you want. Maybe Kendall can slide inside at times. [Jackson] gives you an opportunity to move people around and do some different things schematically because of his man skills.”,Del Rio has worked with a number of cornerbacks who had previously played more man coverage elsewhere and found success in his scheme. Included in that group is Aqib Talib, who while playing for Del Rio in Denver in 2014 had four interceptions, including two returned for touchdowns, plus career highs in passes defensed (16) and tackles for loss (three).,Darby was another who played mostly man coverage before signing with Washington. Last year in Del Rio’s scheme — and in the first season he was fully healthy — Darby recorded a career-high 16 passes defensed and was lauded by Coach Ron Rivera as the team’s “most consistent” cornerback.,Clark said transitioning to a new scheme can come with challenges, but the more difficult switch is for a zone cornerback who is asked to play more man coverage.,“You already know [Jackson] has the requisite skill-set to play the position, period,” Clark said. “When you can do those things, fitting a guy into cover-two or fitting a guy into cover-three or fire zones, which are things run heavily by Jack Del Rio, those things can be done rather than trying to turn a guy who’s a primary zone corner into a press-man guy. … You allow good players to fit into your scheme, and then you use their special traits when needed.,“Darrelle Revis fit into the New England Patriots’ scheme. When they played really good number one receivers, they moved him on the number two [receiver] and doubled the number one. So they give you more schematic flexibility, but you still are going to be who you are at the core.”,At its core, Washington is led by its defensive line, a group that boasts four first-round draft picks, including reigning defensive rookie of the year Chase Young. ,, Washington had the third-highest pass-rush win rate (50 percent) last season, creating trouble for opposing quarterbacks but an incentive for cornerbacks such as Jackson.,“It’s just a blessing to have that front,” Jackson said. “We’ve got a lot of great guys up front. The quarterback’s not going to be able to hold the ball. When we were making the decision, it was very easy because of the front that we have. The defense is already very good. I’m just a piece to make it better.”"

In public, Deshaun Watson is a brilliant, blinding superstar: ,, pristine reputation, charming persona, ,. Yet he now ,, among many alleged sins against massage therapists, of being a “serial predator.”,It’s the most uncomfortable sports story in a time of uncomfortable sports stories, and with each passing day, the accusations gain heft. For two weeks now, , against the Houston Texans quarterback have ,, surfacing one, three, seven claims at a time. Nineteen lawsuits ,. There is zero chance now this scandal bows to Watson’s fame and just goes away.,We’re a long way from clarity about whether Watson is innocent or guilty, whether we knew him as well as we imagined before the lawsuits rained down. We don’t know whether these civil cases could lead to a criminal investigation. We’re even less certain of how the Texans — the bumbling franchise Watson doesn’t want to play for anymore — and the NFL will proceed.,But we must watch. We must look at all the dimensions of this scandal, no matter how disturbing. We cannot pretend this isn’t happening or this will blow over. And even though the world knows Watson, while his accusers are anonymous, we cannot use that as permission to be callous. Watson has all the resources provided by celebrity and wealth. His accusers have legal representation and their stories. They deserve our attention and a sincere vetting.,Let’s get the stardust out of our eyes.,Everything about this escalating situation makes you cringe. For many sports fans, the instinct is to run from it as quickly as possible. For me, the trepidation isn’t limited to utter shock and the sensitivity of the subject matter. No, there’s something more worrisome: a sense that this will be a messy and drawn-out process that sends another terrible message about how the NFL, and the rest of the male-dominated sports world, deals with female claims of abuse.,Unless all the women admit to lying, it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which Watson can be redeemed easily. The charm of his story almost certainly is over, dead. What’s left remains to be seen.,That’s a difficult notion to grasp because, just last month, Watson seemed he was coming into his own at age 25 and doing so impressively. He wasn’t just an elite quarterback. He was , between NFL superstars and team ownership. His , was going to be ,. Now, when having to think about his career, you are inclined to look away.,On Monday, Sports Illustrated published , about a woman not tied to the 19 filings of Texas lawyer Tony Buzbee. The independent reporting cast doubt on theories of a conspiracy. But more than that, I keep thinking about one quote from the latest anonymous massage therapist to come forward.,The woman said to SI’s Jenny Vrentas: “There are so many people that are against us, saying: ‘Why would he do that? He has no reason to do that. He has a beautiful girlfriend; he has this, this, this and this.’ All those things are true, but fame doesn’t create character.”,And anonymity doesn’t authorize mistrust.,Well, it shouldn’t. But that’s a common escape hatch for the accused, and sports figures access it frequently. And here we are, threatening to allow it again. All these years of bad experiences, all this recurrence of abusive tales, all this shame, and we have learned almost nothing about balancing due process for celebrities with the need to protect possible victims. The court of public opinion makes this difficult to do, and lawyers, agents and managers have every right to mount a vigorous defense. But the societal standards for the way we discuss these cases must be elevated, particularly in sports, where men and male attitudes occupy so much space.,At the start of the Watson scandal, his agent defended him on Twitter. David Mulugheta is young, bright and rising quickly in the business. His effort to redirect the conversation about Watson was lazy and dangerous, however. Even worse, it was easy for Watson’s supporters to cling to mindlessly.,“Sexual assault is real,” ,. “Victims should be heard, offenders prosecuted. Individuals fabricate stories in pursuit of financial gain often. Their victims should be heard, and those offenders also prosecuted. I simply hope we keep this same energy with the truth.” Just once, it would be nice if we avoided doing that dangerous, soulless sports and celebrity thing during a situation like this. It would be revolutionary if we didn’t reduce it to a , said/she said conversation in which the accused perversely shares victimhood with the accusers. There is a way to be fair to Watson, to scrutinize the story as it develops but reserve final judgment for later, without shrinking the alleged victims down to gold-digger status.,The legal process is its own sideshow. Buzbee, who lives in the same neighborhood as Texans owner Cal McNair, is known for his flamboyance. As the attorney for the plaintiffs, he seems to be maximizing the rollout of these lawsuits, breaking news nearly every day while hinting that there’s more to come. Rusty Hardin, Watson’s lawyer, , of creating a “circuslike atmosphere by using social media to publicize” the lawsuits. Hardin considers the effort to be “calculated to inflame the public and malign Deshaun’s otherwise sterling reputation.”,Then Hardin went after Buzbee for keeping all of the plaintiffs anonymous.,“In addition, the tactic of refusing our requests to confidentially provide the names of the plaintiffs so we can fully investigate their claims makes uncovering the truth extremely difficult,” he said. “Anonymity is often necessary as a shield for victims, but opposing counsel has used it as a sword to publicly humiliate Deshaun before the truth-seeking process can even begin.”,When the lawyers start posturing, it seems as if the women — the massage therapists who say they couldn’t do their jobs without Watson trying to sexualize the experience — are mere instruments in the fight. For too much of the time, the prevailing story line shifts from the famous Watson’s future to the prominent lawyers’ audacious tussle. All the while, the women are in the background, hoping to stay anonymous but still be seen.,Let’s get the stardust out of our eyes."

According to a person familiar with the proceedings, the vote was unanimous.,Documents presented during the owners’ virtual meeting indicated that the $875 million sale is expected to close this week and will terminate all disputes among Snyder and his co-owners, according to a person familiar with the situation. That would end a contentious dispute between Snyder and his longtime business partners that had produced a grievance, an NFL arbitration process and litigation.,In November, The Washington Post reported that Snyder’s limited partners had , from Behdad Eghbali and José Feliciano, the billionaire co-founders of Clearlake Capital, and Feliciano’s wife, Kwanza Jones.,The sale was blocked, people familiar with the situation said then, because Snyder was attempting to exercise his right of first refusal by matching the offers made to Smith and Rothman but not the offer made to Schar. That resulted in a dispute over whether Snyder was entitled to exercise such rights in a selective manner.,Instead, Snyder will tighten his control over the franchise that he purchased from the Jack Kent Cooke estate in 1999. According to court documents, Snyder currently owns 40.459 percent of the team. His sister, Michele, owns 12.552 percent and his mother, Arlette, owns 6.489 percent.,Wednesday’s final approval came on the second day of a two-day remote meeting of the owners.

The NFL Players Association has pushed for that to continue this year.,“Our process is to follow the science on what is safest for our guys, and many of the changes this past year — like no in-person offseason workouts/practices, the extended acclimation period before training camp and no preseason games — gave us a year of data that demonstrates maintaining some of these changes long-term is in the best interest of the game,” Cleveland Browns center JC Tretter, the NFLPA president, wrote Wednesday ,.,The NFL’s memo to teams Wednesday also said players and teams will be incentivized to be vaccinated.,“It is also anticipated that clubs that achieve a certain rate of vaccination among its tiered staff and players may be permitted to relax restrictions that apply to meetings, mealtime and use of locker rooms,” the league’s memo said."

Washington will face off against the New York Islanders, who are tied for second place in the East Division with the Pittsburgh Penguins, ,times this month.,It will also play Boston (18-9-5, 41 points) three times in April, including twice at TD Garden. Add in the trade deadline in mid-April and these next few weeks will be a strong indicator for where the team is at as it nears its looming playoff push.,Four of the five meetings against the Islanders will be at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, including the Capitals’ next game on Thursday night. The Capitals are 3-0-0 against the Islanders this season. New York is on a two-game losing streak, falling to the Penguins twice.,“They’ve been tight games [against the Islanders], there is not a lot of room out there to create and so we will have to work for that,” Laviolette said. “We will have to work to defend hard, but I think the guys know it is important games, it is big games, as they have been. The Islanders are at tops in the division so we are playing for a lot here.”,The Capitals started their five-game, eight-day road trip Tuesday night with a , at Madison Square Garden.

Washington has won 15 of its past 18 games and have managed to keep its game-changing mistakes to a minimum with a depleted lineup.,“There is always mistakes out on the ice but when they lead to breakaways or guys point blank in front of the net, those are the tough ones,” Laviolette said. “I don’t think we’ve been guilty of a lot of those big mistakes lately but [Tuesday] it caught us. It was a difference in the game.”,While there are positives still to be gleaned from Tuesday’s mishap, Laviolette said he sometimes finds it hard to keep that broad outlook in the moment.,“I probably don’t keep that perspective very well,” Laviolette said. “I was angry last night on the bench, you know when a team is capable and you know how they are capable of playing and I guess you always want to try to play to that standard.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/25/ncaa-women-basketball-tournament-revenue/,The NCAA’s shell game is the real women’s basketball scandal,"The NCAA’s , is either malpractice or malfeasance. It’s one or the other. The issue is not just petty skimping on food, the ,, the willful lack of promotion. Something much bigger is going on here, a kind of larceny. And Congress should make the NCAA crack open the books on it.,Short of stifling Geno Auriemma with a pillow while stealing his diamond championship rings, the NCAA could not work harder to smother the potential of the women’s tournament and rob it of revenue. This week, in response to a query about its financials, the NCAA insisted again that the women don’t turn a profit. This is patently unjustifiable. You know how much revenue NCAA Division I women’s basketball generated collectively in 2018-2019? Almost a billion dollars. That’s according to economist Daniel Rascher, a financial analyst for the firm OSKR who studied the NCAA’s self-reported numbers and testified as an expert in the governing body’s ,. “I don’t see how they lose money on it,” he says.,You know how many companies will advertise on ESPN during this women’s tournament, brands that want to be associated with the elegance of stars such as , and Stanford’s Kiana Williams, who play the game like strings of silk? A total of 77, among them Verizon, Chevrolet, L’Oréal and Nike.,You know how many viewers watched ,? More than 3.68 million, with a peak of 5.6 million in the closing minutes of Baylor’s one-point victory over Notre Dame. Know what that’s comparable to? A Wimbledon men’s final. Game 1 of the 2019 National League Division Series between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers. LeBron James’s debut with the Los Angeles Lakers. Hannity.,So if the NCAA can’t come out ahead on an ESPN championship with millions of viewers, which is it? Incompetence or indifference?,Someone on Capitol Hill should snatch NCAA President Mark Emmert by the lapel and demand that he explain his math. What is the NCAA counting — and more importantly, not counting — when it insists the women’s tournament “does not generate any net revenue?” Asked his opinion of this contention, marketing analyst Tony Pace laughs out loud. Pace is the former chief marketing officer for Subway and now president of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board. “My impression is that you can do a lot of funny things with cost accounting,” he says.,The revenue discussion is “pejorative,” Pace says. “First of all, they are revenue-producing.”,The NCAA is playing three-card monte. There is no question ratings for early round women’s games can be negligible, especially when aired piecemeal on ESPN’s substations, which means lower ad pricing and revenue. Nevertheless, watch any women’s tournament game on ESPN’s channels, and you’ll see prominent title sponsor placements for AT&T, Capital One and Coca-Cola. The lineup of commercial breaks includes State Farm, Liberty Mutual and Kentucky Fried Chicken, among others. Pricing in media buys is always a complex calculation, dependent on time slot and event cachet, but these companies did not pay nothing. This is a Disney-owned network we’re talking about. ESPN made the decision to expand coverage and air all 63 games nationally this year, presumably because it knew it could sell ads against it.,According to Jim Minnich, senior vice president of sports revenue management for Disney Advertising Sales, the ad prices for the women’s tournament are “comparable” to events with similar-sized audiences. As for the tournament as a whole, “We’ve been very happy with its performance from both a demand and audience standpoint,” he says.,Dodge. Crest. Bounty. M&Ms. Dunkin’.,What’s remarkable is that the women’s event has managed to grow at all in the face of neglect. The NCAA doesn’t even devote decent floor decals to the women’s games, decals that denote this is a championship event. Live-apps, interactive brackets and updates are interest-drivers that “build the business,” Pace says, and not having them included with the “NCAA March Madness” campaign suppresses the audience. Still, of the women’s 77 advertisers this year, 17 are new. “That’s a really good number,” Pace says.,Dairy Queen. Chevron. Peloton. Cisco.,Just watch the ads. How on earth does the NCAA justify this slurring of women as dead weight? The NCAA men’s tournament, with its $19 billion, multiyear deal with Turner-CBS is, of course, gargantuan — but that doesn’t account for the disproportionality. How is it that a supposed educational nonprofit gives a men’s team that wins a single tournament game a revenue-share payout of $2 million, while the team that wins an entire women’s championship — that is also “presented by Capital One” — gets not a cent?,Here’s how they work it. The NCAA has a fistful of colossal sponsorship and media deals. ESPN paid $500 million for a TV pact that bundles the women’s tournament with 24 championships. Then there is the NCAA Corporate Champions and Partners Program, a massive agreement for dollars and services with AT&T, Capital One and Coca-Cola. A lower tier includes 15 more corporate “partners” such as Marriott and Nabisco.,What is the value assigned to women’s basketball in all of this? The NCAA is opaque, perhaps deliberately. “Part of the issue is that they blend the revenues from the media deals,” Rascher points out. When you start pulling at threads, you find the NCAA has a highly flexible definition of “costs,” amid a tangle of revenue streams, unallocated funds, resources and values-in-kind. During discovery in the antitrust cases, Rascher found that the NCAA’s bookkeeping claims “depend on the story they’re telling,” he says.,The story the NCAA has long told to women’s basketball is this: It is a cost burden, a subsidized sport “that should feel lucky to be there,” Rascher says.,As long as the NCAA can make the women’s basketball tournament seem “net” poor, nobody will bother much about it, right? It makes it harder for women’s coaches to campaign for budgets and revenue shares, and for female stars such as Paige Bueckers to argue that they deserve to be paid. And it makes it easier for campus administrators, 83 percent of whom are White men, to continue to pour money into funhouse opulence such as ,.,This is behind , at the women’s tournament in San Antonio this week. For 40 years they’ve been told by male officials, “If only you paid your own way.” So they built a championship from scratch, an in-demand television event with enormous potential. And what do they get for it? They get used as a write-down, put down in the ledgers as “losers” no matter how much they win, and have to suffer the mansplaining of Emmert while they’re at it.,Emmert , to get to the bottom of the “blunders” that led to disparate treatment of the women’s tournament. But to get to the bottom of it, just go straight to the top. No one has been a bigger perpetrator of this shell game lie than Emmert. The NCAA spends a gazillion dollars on all kinds of , expenses, including his $2.7 million compensation, and then claims the, generate “no net revenue?” This is not real accounting. It’s a murder of the English language in hopes of buying time for the wheelmen to start the getaway car."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/evan-mobley-nba-draft/,What NBA front offices are saying about Evan Mobley as a top draft prospect,"Evan Mobley’s sensational freshman season and strong NCAA tournament run for Southern California abruptly ended in the Elite Eight on Tuesday, when ,.,For the 7-foot Mobley, there was no shame in losing this showdown with Jalen Suggs. Gonzaga’s freshman guard — who finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists to Mobley’s 17 points, five rebounds and three assists — had far more help thanks to a fearsome and cohesive Bulldogs roster that stands two wins from a perfect 32-0 season after an 85-66 victory.,But the comparisons among Mobley, Suggs and the other projected top-five picks in a , are just beginning in advance of the July 29 NBA draft. As the only big man among this year’s top-tier prospects, Mobley, 19, represents the latest test of the evolving value of a modern NBA big man. He arrives with a tantalizing skill set that could set him apart from other prospects whose high selections have resulted in second-guessing.,“He isn’t Anthony Davis, but he’s in that mold,” one Western Conference executive said. “That’s the mold I want.”,The NBA’s pace-and-space era has drastically altered the job description for elite centers: Rather than dominating with post-ups and hoarding rebounds, coveted big men can shoot from the outside, create for their teammates and handle a wide variety of defensive assignments, from stepping out against guards to protecting the basket area. The Denver Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic and the Philadelphia 76ers’ Joel Embiid have garnered MVP attention thanks in large part to their multilayered offensive games, while the Los Angeles Lakers’ Davis and the Miami Heat’s Bam Adebayo, two of the league’s most complete big men, met in the 2020 Finals.,Identifying these game-changing big men when they’re teenagers remains a maddening process. Davis and Embiid were both high lottery picks, but Adebayo dropped to 14th in 2017 and Jokic lasted until the second round in 2014. All four stars required major development during their professional careers, and other recent high lottery picks have yet to follow their lead down the star track.,Dragan Bender, the first big taken in 2016, didn’t pan out, and no big men were selected in the top nine picks of 2017. Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III, the top two picks in 2018, have been overshadowed by Luka Doncic and Trae Young, perimeter playmakers who went later in the top five. Zion Williamson has transformed into an oversized initiator — “Point Zion” — rather than the small-ball center many envisioned when he was selected first in 2019. And there are growing whispers that LaMelo Ball, a lead ballhandler, should have been selected over lithe center James Wiseman, last year’s second pick.,But NBA front-office executives and scouts generally pushed back on the notion that Mobley, who was the Pac-12 player of the year and defensive player of the year, should be docked based solely on positional considerations. While Suggs and Oklahoma State guard Cade Cunningham project as possible franchise players who could make an immediate impact as rookies, several decision-makers argued that Mobley can develop into a prototypical modern big.,“I like Mobley much more than Ayton, Bagley and Wiseman” when they were coming out, an Eastern Conference executive said. “He [projects as] a much better defender. He’s better with the ball. Bagley and Wiseman were mistakes. You don’t want to make a mistake [by not taking Mobley] because you were trying to avoid someone else’s mistake.”,The seven evaluators, who were reached by telephone and text message before USC’s loss to Gonzaga and spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, praised Mobley’s comfort playing on the perimeter on both offense and defense, his length, his shot-blocking skills and his ability to attack off the dribble and find the open man.,One Western Conference executive said Mobley must fill out physically like Davis has throughout his 20s, but he added in a text message that he considered Mobley a strong candidate to go first overall because “size still matters. SIZE WILL ALWAYS MATTER IN BASKETBALL.”,The relative value of sheer size has come under scrutiny in recent years as slow-footed traditional centers have found it harder to earn big contracts and playoff minutes. Jokic has played his best basketball after slimming down, while two-time all-star center Andre Drummond, a big-bodied volume rebounder, was recently bought out by the Cleveland Cavaliers after failing to generate interest before the trade deadline.,“There were playable centers available for cheap in free agency,” a Western Conference executive said. “There were plenty of centers on the buyout market. This is a guard’s game, and centers [who aren’t elite] are treated like running backs in the NFL. At some point, that carries over to how teams draft. If I have a top pick, the big has to do it all. [Only] finishing lobs isn’t enough. [Only] blocking shots isn’t enough. [Only] shooting threes isn’t enough. There is a hell of a high threshold on young big men right now.”,An Eastern Conference executive agreed: “Any player I pick high in the draft now, including bigs, must have a diverse skill set. Ballhandling. Shooting. All of it.”,Mobley isn’t a flawless prospect, although he averaged an impressive 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.9 blocks per game. The Murrieta, Calif., native must improve as a three-point shooter and free throw shooter, and he is not a back-to-the-basket scoring force. Although Mobley appears to be a more creative and dynamic all-around offensive threat than Ayton, who has settled into a complementary role for the Phoenix Suns, he is not as silky or as advanced as Davis.,“[My checklist is] defense, efficient scoring and playmaking,” a Western Conference executive said. “A center who shoots a high percentage from the line, is efficient at the rim, can pass the ball and handle a little bit even if they haven’t gotten their shooting range is still super valuable. Especially if they can dominate defensively.”,Indeed, defensive mobility and impact are perhaps the greatest cause for excitement for Mobley, who trusts his feet and displays a strong commitment to contesting shots.,If Mobley does go with one of the top few selections, his new team probably will pass on Suggs as well as Jalen Green and Jonathan Kuminga, a pair of perimeter athletes who spent this season playing for the ,. Such a decision could easily set up another round of “Ayton vs. Doncic” or “Ball vs. Wiseman” debates.,Mobley has “zero bust potential,” one Western Conference scout said, dismissing such talk. “He can really defend the pick and roll, so he can play in fourth quarters. Bagley can’t. The jury is out on Wiseman. Mobley can switch and protect the rim. It’s hard to find both in the same player. There’s enough there on offense. You can’t be afraid to miss big.”"

He beat a segregationist restaurateur, Lester Maddox, who was infamous for refusing to serve Black would-be diners.,“I could promise all I wanted about Atlanta’s bright, booming economic future,” ,, “but none of it would come about if Atlanta failed to cope with the racial issue.” Keeping his pledge, Allen two years later became the only Southern mayor to testify in support of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, , guaranteed equal voting rights for people of color and lesser means.,Two years later, the the city , and Major League Baseball moved a club there from Milwaukee. In 1968, the NBA relocated the St. Louis Hawks to Georgia Tech’s downtown coliseum.,In more recent years, Atlanta got a WNBA team, an MLS club and two NHL franchises (though it lost both). It has hosted several Super Bowls, Final Fours and those Olympic Games centered on that park off Allen Jr. Boulevard. It would have been the site of the 2020 Final Four, ,.,In short, Atlanta became one of our country’s leading sports cities, largely thanks to Allen’s daringness to champion racial equality in the South, starting at the voting booth.,But this month, just over half a century later, reactionary Georgia politicians acted to shove their state and Atlanta back in time , that threaten the protections for Black Georgians that Allen advocated for — with his actions ultimately attracting our national sports industry, which is at least symbolically representative of the meritocracy in which most of us strive to live.,So until further notice, what sports brought to Atlanta, it should take away.,As , upon seeing Georgia State Rep. Park Cannon (D), a Black woman, , for knocking on the office door of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) — mimicking the worst scenes of the old Jim Crow South — baseball should lead the way by moving its All-Star Game, ,, to another city. MLB players’ union head , was open to talking to Commissioner Rob Manfred about exactly that.,“Players are very much aware,” Clark told the Boston Globe. “As it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue. If there is an opportunity to, we would look forward to having that conversation.”,Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, ,, also said last week , as a form of protest.,Moving the game wouldn’t be unprecedented. The NBA , in protest of North Carolina’s so-called bathroom bill, which discriminated against transgender people. The NFL , from Phoenix after Arizona voters rejected propositions that would have made Martin Luther King Jr. Day an official state holiday. And in 1965, the American Football League , after Black stars refused to play upon being shunned at hotels and restaurants in the city.,Baseball isn’t the only sport that can protest Georgia’s infringement on basic democratic rights with inhuman rules such as not allowing third-party groups to hand out bottles of water to voters standing in line. FIFA, soccer’s international governing body, should disqualify Atlanta as a candidate to be one of ,hosting the 2026 World Cup. It should nix the suggestion, too, that Atlanta’s broadcast infrastructure be the hub for the tournament’s media production., would be given “significant consideration” for the next Final Four up for bid after losing last year’s canceled event. The NCAA should scratch that thought now.,This could be yet another example of how sport can serve a greater good and live up to its vision of itself as an agent of social change. Atlanta saw it exercised recently when WNBA players , (D) to unseat then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R), who was co-owner of the Atlanta Dream , in particular and many women’s rights in general. The players not only succeeded in getting , but also ,.,That was using sports as an agent for social change. What Allen did was turn sports into a , for social change, a development he helped spearhead in Atlanta along with King and the city’s other legendary civil rights leaders. Sports even turned out to be a catalyst to recast the image of the state and its flagship city, propelling both into larger leadership roles in the South.,There was a time when Georgia and Atlanta were vying with Alabama and Birmingham to be the most influential region of the South. But a onetime baseball announcer in Alabama named Bull Connor, elected to Birmingham’s misnamed position of commissioner of public safety, became the face of the state’s brutal response to Black Alabamians advocating for civil rights. He enforced Birmingham’s ,, which made it illegal for Black and White people to participate together in any recreation, including checkers.,The law locked Birmingham out of the pro baseball exhibition circuit after Jackie Robinson was allowed to play in the major leagues. Connor even enforced it against an integrated all-star game organized by Robinson in 1953. The game was played only after Robinson sat the White players.,The racist intransigence of that generation of White Alabama leaders remains reflected in the state and Birmingham today. The South’s major airport developed in Atlanta. Birmingham never got an NFL, NBA or MLB team. The best it ever got was a football team in the short-lived USFL and Michael Jordan’s tenure with the city’s minor league baseball team.,That’s where Atlanta could be if not for Allen’s victory and leading role in ensuring voting rights for Georgians of color. And that’s what sports should remind those elected Georgians — the ones acting to take the state back to an ugly yesteryear — right now."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/karl-anthony-towns-mom-dad/,Karl-Anthony Towns played before his father for the first time since his mother died of covid,"Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves played Monday night with his father in attendance for the first time since his mother died of covid-19 nearly a year ago.,“Me and my dad got emotional before the game,” , against the Nets at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, “because he made his presence known. It affected me because my mom always did that.”,Jacqueline Cruz-Towns, whom her son has called the “boss” of the family, often attended her son’s games, sitting near the court and enthusiastically cheering him on.,“My mom would be the one to go at the stanchion,” Towns said Monday, “or be there and wave at me until I said hi to her or came and hugged her.”,Towns revealed in March 2020 that his mother was , and in a medically induced coma after contracting the ,. In talking about the experience in ,, Towns pleaded with the public to take the pandemic seriously.,“The severity of this disease is real,” he warned in the video. “This disease needs to not be taken lightly. Please protect your family, your loved ones, your friends, yourself. Practice social distancing. Please don’t be in places with a lot of people. This disease is deadly.”,Jacqueline Cruz-Towns, 58,,. His father, Karl Towns Sr., also contracted the virus and was hospitalized. The Timberwolves star, who contracted the virus himself in January, said in December that the disease had killed seven of his family members.,After a Timberwolves win later that month, Towns described ,. “I don’t even recognize most of my other games and years I’ve played and how I felt those days,” he told reporters. “If I can be honest with y’all for a second, I mean, I don’t really recall or really care. I only know what happened from April 13 on. Because you may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13. He’s never coming back. I don’t remember that man. I don’t know that man. You’re talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago.”,In April, a family spokesman described the family as “heartbroken” by her death. “Jackie was many things to many people — a wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. … She was an incredible source of strength; a fiery, caring, and extremely loving person, who touched everyone she met. Her passion was palpable and her energy will never be replaced.”,Before Monday’s game, Towns spotted his father, who was wearing a jersey with the family name on this back, and trotted over to greet him. Towns, who grew up in New Jersey, went on to score 31 points with 12 rebounds and five assists in a 112-107 loss to the Nets. About a dozen family members attended the game, and afterward Towns hung around to play tag on the court with a niece and nephew.,“It was really the first time having family watch me playing in person” since the pandemic began, Towns said, “and it’s crazy seeing my dad. I’m like: ‘Where’s my mom? She’s going to come.’ And, obviously, she’s not going to show up. That affected me, but I go out there and play the best I can for this team.”,“He understood how upset I was after the loss,” Towns added, “but he came to me, and he told me something I don’t know if he should’ve told me. It got me a little emotional. He told me my mom would’ve been proud with how I played tonight.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/nfl-mock-draft-49ers-trade/,NFL mock draft: Where the first-round QBs will land after the 49ers traded up,"The , of the 2021 NFL draft raises some fascinating possibilities.,Most likely, the 49ers moved up to take a quarterback. That could lead to three quarterbacks being drafted in the first three picks, which has happened only twice in NFL history. If the Atlanta Falcons then take a quarterback with the fourth selection or another team trades up to do so, the NFL would have four quarterbacks go in the first four picks — which has never happened.,The timing of the trade was fitting, as it took place Friday when Zach Wilson was holding his pro day workout. The Brigham Young quarterback is increasingly being projected as the second pick by the New York Jets, which could mean the 49ers’ choice comes down to Alabama’s Mac Jones or North Dakota State’s Trey Lance.,Quarterbacks occupying the top few picks will have a trickle-down effect. Let’s take a look at how the first round could shake out with our latest mock draft:,New coach Urban Meyer acknowledged this week the likelihood that the Jaguars would make Lawrence the top pick, which has been what everyone has been assuming since Jacksonville locked up the No. 1 selection. Lawrence is one of the highest-rated quarterbacks to enter the pros in years.,Wilson’s strong workout Friday came pretty close to locking him in as the Jets’ selection at No. 2. Rumors started leaking out after the workout that Sam Darnold might be available in a trade. The Jets probably would need to be willing to accept less than a first-rounder for Darnold in a trade — the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos are two possibilities — given that the acquiring team might not pick up Darnold’s fifth-year option. Wilson would give them the chance to start over with a top talent at the position.,Late last season, 49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan said he liked the Kansas City Chiefs’ plan of developing a quarterback that they used in drafting Patrick Mahomes and having him sit behind starter Alex Smith for a year. If they were to replicate that model with Jimmy Garoppolo, whom they said after the trade is still their starter for this year, the most logical selection is Lance. He only played one game last year and faced a lower level of competition in college but has great physical tools and upside. Mac Jones is the most NFL-ready of this year’s quarterbacks after Lawrence and should be under consideration as well.,The Falcons could take quarterback Justin Fields, but they still appear to be leaning toward taking a position player to help build around Matt Ryan. Sewell, the best blocker in the draft, can come in as a rookie and start at guard, then move to tackle next year.,Sewell would make sense here if he falls to the Bengals, but if not, Pitts, who despite being a tight end could be the best pass-catcher in the draft, is a great option.,The Dolphins didn’t mind trading down from the third pick to the 12th because it got them first-rounders in 2022 and 2023, and then they promptly sent their 2022 first-rounder to the Eagles to move back up six spots in this year’s order. Presumably, that was to land one of the top pass-catchers in this year’s draft to help second-year quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Chase is a dynamic, big target who would pair well opposite Will Fuller V, the speedster who signed in free agency.,There might only end up being two defensive players among the first 12 selections, and Parsons has the chance to be one of them. He has the range and speed to be a playmaker on defense. The Lions could consider Justin Fields here, but they seem intent on going with Jared Goff at quarterback this year.,Owner David Tepper is willing to give up just about anything to upgrade at quarterback. His preference is Deshaun Watson, but the Houston Texans say they aren’t trading him, and it remains to be seen ,. The Panthers are a candidate to trade up and draft a passer, but in this scenario Fields drops to them.,The Broncos could consider Mac Jones in this scenario if they can’t get a veteran quarterback before the draft. But they also have the luxury of taking the best player available after restocking their defense in free agency, and Slater qualifies.,With Caleb Farley having a back procedure, Surtain became the clear-cut top cornerback in the draft. And the Cowboys need to improve their pass coverage.,General Manager Dave Gettleman is looking for good players along his offensive and defensive lines, and Vera-Tucker would help make up for the loss of guard Kevin Zeitler, who was cut this offseason. He has been rising up draft boards after a good pro day workout.,The Eagles didn’t mind moving back in the first round, knowing they are rebuilding and could have as many as three first-round picks in next year’s draft. Horn is a physical cornerback who is great in man-to-man coverage. Philadelphia could also draft a wide receiver here to help second-year quarterback Jalen Hurts.,The Chargers needed to fix their offensive line in front of second-year quarterback Justin Herbert, and they did well in free agency by signing Corey Linsley at center and adding the second-best available guard in Matt Feiler. Darrisaw would complete the overhaul.,The Vikings have done well on defense by getting cornerback Patrick Peterson and tackle Dalvin Tomlinson in free agency, and the next move should be to address the pass rush. Paye is a great athlete and could develop opposite Danielle Hunter.,Jones could go as high as No. 3, and for the Patriots to land him they might need to trade up. They are in position to do so after Bill Belichick filled many roster holes in free agency. Jones would be a good fit to develop behind starter Cam Newton, given his experience in the pro-style offense Nick Saban runs at Alabama.,Even after signing Malcolm Butler last week, the Cardinals still need help at cornerback following Peterson’s departure. Farley is one of the best cornerbacks in the draft and a great value at this spot.,The Raiders will be looking for a defensive lineman or an offensive lineman, but there is no way they pass on a pass-catcher as good as Smith if he falls this far.,Miami traded Shaq Lawson, so edge rusher is a need. This would be a good spot for Oweh, who has great physical ability, to develop.,Washington has addressed its offense in free agency, signing quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and wide receivers Curtis Samuel and Adam Humphries. It could bolster its line with Jenkins, who is an excellent run blocker.,The Bears had to cut cornerback Kyle Fuller to stay under the salary cap. Newsome gives them a cornerback they can plug and play right away.,The Colts are looking for a replacement for retired left tackle Anthony Castonzo. They signed Sam Tevi but gave him backup money on a one-year, $2.5 million deal. Cosmi is 6-7, 309 pounds and a very good pass-blocker.,The Titans lost Humphries and Corey Davis, so wide receiver is one of their biggest needs. Waddle has great speed and quickness and could be drafted much earlier than this, but the depth of the wideout class could lead to some teams waiting until Day 2 to draft one. Waddle is also a good returner.,The Jets have a desperate need at cornerback, and with good size at 6-2, Joseph fits the profile of what Coach Robert Saleh wants at the position.,The Steelers will be tempted to take a running back with their first-round pick, but they need a replacement for Bud Dupree and have a long history of taking edge rushers in the first round.,The Jaguars are switching to a 3-4 defense, so they need to beef up the interior of their defensive line. Barmore is disruptive and would be a good fit.,Collins is one of the best pure 4-3 linebackers available, so the Browns would get great value in drafting him here.,The Ravens lost two pass rushers in free agency when Yannick Ngakoue signed with Las Vegas and Matthew Judon went to New England. Owusu-Koramoah is known for his coverage more than his pass-rush ability, but he nonetheless fills a need at linebacker.,The Saints had to cut Emmanuel Sanders, so they need a wide receiver who is quick off the line of scrimmage and a good route-runner. Bateman fits the bill.,The Packers need to get some wideout help for Aaron Rodgers. Marshall has good size and big-play ability.,The Bills are always looking for pass-rush help. They’ll feel fortunate if Phillips falls to them toward the bottom of the first round.,The Chiefs are rebuilding their offensive line after injuries left them compromised during their Super Bowl loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They started by signing guards Joe Thuney and Kyle Long, but they need to add one more lineman, likely a tackle, with this pick.,Moehrig is the best safety in the draft, so it’s hard to see him slipping into the second round."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/usopc-olympic-trials-protests-rule-50/,"USOPC will allow social justice demonstrations at Olympic trials, pushing back against IOC rule","In an open letter to American athletes Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee provided guidance on permitted social and racial justice demonstrations, saying it would allow acts such as raised fists on the podium and kneeling during the national anthem. Such permission places the national committee at odds with the International Olympic Committee’s staunch rule against political protest.,The USOPC’s policy applies to Team USA trials this spring and summer but not to the Tokyo Olympics, which the IOC will oversee. The IOC steadfastly has resisted calls from athletes around the globe, ,, to overturn Rule 50, the rule in the Olympic charter that outlaws “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda.”,“While we support your right to demonstrate peacefully in support of racial and social justice, we can’t control the actions others may take in response,” USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland wrote Tuesday.,Hammer thrower Gwen Berry, whom the USOPC placed on probation after she raised her fist on the podium in protest of racial inequality after winning gold at the 2019 Pan American Games, praised the letter as bold and well done. She believes support from the USOPC, despite the threat of punishment from the IOC, may give confidence to athletes who otherwise would have backed down from protesting at the Olympics.,“Real issues are highlighted when people have support,” Berry said. “When people don’t have support, they’ll just hide in the shadows and they won’t say anything. The fact that we do have support now, you never know how somebody will flourish and the issues some people will talk about.”,In the letter, Hirshland included guidance for the trials that “defines latitude for athletes to express their personal perspectives on racial and social justice in a respectful way, and without fear of sanction from the USOPC.”,The USOPC defined racial and social demonstration as “promoting the human dignity of individuals or groups that have historically been underrepresented, minoritized, or marginalized in their respective societal context.” Its specific examples of approved demonstration included wearing a hat with the phrase “Black Lives Matter” or “Trans Lives Matter,” vocally advocating for equal rights for minorities, holding up a fist, and kneeling during the national anthem.,The USOPC’s letter also outlined “impermissible elements” of demonstration that would result in discipline. They include wearing clothing with hate speech; hand gestures affiliated with hate groups; violence; defacing a national flag; and “protests aimed explicitly against a specific organization, person or group of people.”,“I feel like it was important that they did include things that they will not allow,” Berry said. “Things that are discriminatory. Things that will not enhance the growth of any type of social reform. I think that was really important to put in there. Some people might try to rebel. They might say, ‘Well since this issue can be highlighted or acknowledge, why can’t this?’ The details in what is allowed and not allowed, I feel like they did a very good with implementing that.”,While providing athletes support, the new guidelines create a maze of hypothetical quandaries for the USOPC. For example, if an athlete takes aim at the IOC for not pressuring China — the host country of the 2022 Winter Olympics — on human rights violations, would that be considered a protest explicitly against a specific organization?,The USOPC has struggled for years with how to approach athlete protest. Even as it came to celebrate the famed 1968 raised-fist protest of racial injustice by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, it took cues from the IOC and followed international guidelines that prohibited demonstrations. In 2019, the USOPC placed fencer Race Imboden and Berry on probation after Imboden knelt on the podium and Berry raised a fist during the national anthem at the Pan American Games in Peru.,Hirshland ,, when amid widespread civic protests of racial injustice athletes shared their experiences and concerns during a virtual town hall. The USOPC then formed “an athlete-led group to challenge the rules and systems in our own organization that create barriers to progress, including your right to protest.” Hirshland also apologized to athletes who “sacrificed your moment on the podium to call for change.”,In December, the Team USA Council on Racial and Social Justice, backed by the USOPC, joined the USOPC Athletes’ Advisory Council in calling on the IOC to change Rule 50.,The IOC Athletes’ Commission has been reviewing Rule 50 and could make a recommendation on keeping or changing the rule before the Tokyo Games, perhaps this month. IOC President Thomas Bach has supported Rule 50, writing in an October , in the Guardian that the Games should not “descend into a marketplace of demonstrations of all kinds, dividing and not uniting the world.”,The IOC did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.,After a year of racial reckoning in the United States, the IOC is likely to be tested in Tokyo. Sprinter Noah Lyles, projected to be one of the Games’ biggest stars, , of a Diamond League track meet in Monaco last summer. He is one of several Americans who have said they would consider a protest in Tokyo. If they do, they’ll have the backing of their governing body.,“I feel like it’s a victory for all the Black athletes in America who do feel that America has more work to do as far as supporting people who look like us,” Berry said. “It’s a victory for everybody, honestly.”"

Teams will play one additional regular season game and one fewer preseason game beginning with the 2021 season.,It is the first modification to the length of the NFL season since the league went from a 14-game schedule to a 16-game regular season in 1978. The NFL also announced that it plans for four of the 16 additional games per season, beginning in 2022, to be ,.,NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the move “momentous” and said during a conference call with reporters, “This change clearly is going to provide fans with more meaningful and quality games that otherwise would not have been scheduled.”,Goodell also said the league plans to “have full stadiums in the upcoming season” after the NFL completed its 2020 season with games played in empty or partially filled stadiums amid the , pandemic.,“We’re also discussing our plans to welcome back all of our fans for the 2021 season across the country at all NFL stadiums,” Goodell said. “As you know, we had 1.2 million fans safely attend games last year. All of us in the NFL want to see every one of our fans back. Football is simply not the same without fans, and we expect to have full stadiums in the upcoming season.”,League officials reiterated Tuesday that, based on studies, no clusters of coronavirus cases have been traced to any of the 119 NFL games last season at which fans were in attendance.,Owners long had sought to lengthen the regular season as a revenue-boosting measure. They proposed an 18-game season, with a two-game preseason, during their labor negotiations with the NFL Players Association that led to the 2011 collective bargaining agreement. The union objected on player-safety grounds and called the proposal a non-starter, and owners abandoned the measure for that labor deal.,But they came back to it during the negotiations that led to last year’s new CBA. The owners’ focus shifted to 17 games when the union remained firmly against an 18-game season, and the , became the owners getting a 17-game season in exchange for the players getting 48 percent of the league’s revenue under the salary cap system, with a “kicker” mechanism to potentially take that to 48.5 percent or slightly above. The union’s safety concerns had been mollified by cutbacks to the amount of hitting that players endure during the offseason and on the practice field.,The CBA was , in March 2020, giving the owners the right to implement the 17-game season as soon as 2021. That was accompanied by an expansion of the playoff field from 12 to 14 teams, which went into effect this past season. The 17-game season was incorporated by the owners into their negotiation of the , worth more than $110 billion over 11 years through the 2033 season. Teams divide that revenue evenly, and players receive their share under the salary cap.,The completion of the broadcasting deals was viewed as the final step toward enacting the 17-game season, and the outcome of the owners’ vote Tuesday was considered a foregone conclusion.,Owners , in December. The additional home game will rotate annually by conference. AFC teams will have nine home games each in the 2021 regular season, while NFC teams have eight apiece. That will be reversed in 2022.,The extra game will be an out-of-conference game based on the divisional order of finish from the previous season. For the 2021 season, AFC East teams play NFC East teams; AFC North teams face NFC West teams; AFC South teams oppose NFC South teams; and AFC West teams play NFC North teams. So, for example, the Kansas City Chiefs, the first-place team in the AFC West last season, will host the Green Bay Packers, the first-place team in the NFC North.,The NFL also announced that the 2021 regular season will begin Sept. 9 and conclude Jan. 9. The schedule for the 2021 season is expected to be released in May.,The three-game preseason is expected to result in teams having a bye during what, until now, has been Week 4 of the preseason schedule. Each team will still have one bye week during the regular season, which now becomes 18 weeks long.,That pushes back the postseason by one week. The Super Bowl for the 2021 season will be played Feb. 13, 2022, in Los Angeles, one week before Presidents’ Day weekend. Had the 2020 season been one week longer, this year’s Super Bowl would have been played on the Sunday immediately before Presidents’ Day, giving the nation a holiday on the day after the year’s most-watched TV event.,Under the NFL’s international plan, four of the additional 16 games in a 17-game season will be chosen as neutral-site games each year and played internationally. Each team will play an international game at least once every eight years, giving the league scheduling certainty as it attempts to increase its popularity worldwide.,Some players have continued to express their opposition to a 17-game season, even after their ratification of the CBA last year by a 60-vote margin. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara , over the weekend that a 17-game season is “dumb … as hell.”,The NFL informed teams Tuesday that they can begin their offseason programs for players April 19, according to a person familiar with the matter. There has been no agreement yet between the league and the NFLPA about offseason rules and to what extent teams might have on-field practices, if at all."

A defender draped on her, she gathered the ball near the top of the key. A hand in her face, she let it fly.,Bueckers’s dagger bounced impossibly high off the back rim before falling in — her 11th, 12th and 13th consecutive points for the Huskies down the stretch, and her 29th, 30th and 31st for the game as U-Conn., ranked No. 2 nationally at the time, took down top-ranked South Carolina.,“There’s guys who lug the piano up onstage, and there’s guys who play the piano. And there’s a reason why the guy who plays the piano makes all the money — because that’s what people come to watch,” Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma said afterward. “Paige is a good piano player.”,As the top-seeded Huskies (24-1) prepare to open a most unusual NCAA women’s tournament Sunday night against No. 16 seed High Point — in a ,quarantine “bubble” in San Antonio, and without Auriemma, who tested positive for the , this past week — it is worth revisiting their hard-earned win against South Carolina, both for what it said about Bueckers, who, at 19, might already be the best player in the country, and about U-Conn.,First, about U-Conn.: No other program could call a four-year period featuring three Final Four appearances (and one tournament canceled by a global pandemic) a drought. But in Storrs, where success is measured solely by national titles, the term fits. Last spring, the Huskies, for the first time since 2008, graduated a senior class that failed to win an NCAA title.,All 10 of their championships this century have been won behind generational talents — Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Breanna Stewart — who have 13 WNBA championships and 23 first-team all-WNBA nods. But none of them were asked to step in as freshmen and do what Bueckers has this season, for a Huskies team that has five other freshmen and no seniors.,She is averaging 35.7 minutes, nearly 14 more than Stewart did as a freshman, while scoring more points (19.7) than Moore (17.8) did and dishing out nearly twice as many assists (6.1) as Taurasi turned in (3.3).,“It’s been a long time since one player has had to carry the team as much as she’s had to in some of these games,” Auriemma said.,The South Carolina win was the most vivid example, proving that, when tested, U-Conn. will put the ball in Bueckers’s hands and ask her to win the game. Such tests are few and far between; U-Conn.’s 10 wins since Feb. 8, including three in the Big East tournament, have come by an average margin of 33 points. But she’s there if the Huskies need it.,“Coach put in my head as a [high school] senior how he was going to want me to step in and be a leader right away,” Bueckers said in a telephone interview. “That was kind of different — actually learning and going through the process of being a good leader for the team right away.”,Bueckers played all 45 minutes against South Carolina, scored the game’s final four points of regulation and all nine for the Huskies in overtime, single-handedly outscoring the nation’s No. 1 team 13-5 in that span. It was her third straight 30-point game, something no other player in U-Conn. history had done. Those last three points came with everyone in the arena knowing she would be taking that shot.,“How does the legend grow from here?” Monica McNutt, the color commentator on Fox Sports 1 that night, blurted as the shot fell through. That was followed by: “Wh-what?” And moments later, with an uneasy chuckle: “This is scary. This is very scary.”,A month later, McNutt, a former standout guard at Georgetown, still had trouble processing what she had seen.,“I will admit I was a little skeptical,” McNutt said in a telephone interview. “But, boy, did she shut me up. She’s as good as anyone I’ve seen at that age.”,Bueckers already has joined Moore as the only freshmen to be named the Big East freshman of the year and player of the year in the same season. She has a chance to become the only freshman in history to be named national player of the year. By at least one objective measure, the honor would be warranted: Her 11.0 win shares, per ,, lead the nation.,If there is a secret remaining with Bueckers — her fame underscored by an Instagram account that has more followers at the moment than those of Bird, Rudy Gobert and Katie Ledecky, among others — it lies in the question of how:,How does she coax so much production out of a 5-foot-11 frame so unsubstantial that her high school coach nicknamed her “Olive Oyl” after the gangly Popeye character?,How, at 19, can she carry a team that plays its home games beneath 11 national championship banners?,Put more simply: How is she so good?,The answer can be arrived at in a few ways.,Obviously, she is athletically gifted, with impressive speed, enough hops to grab the rim and remarkable hand-eye coordination. Though she stopped playing baseball after fourth grade, her father, Bob, said she made the league all-star team: “When she threw the ball, it was on a rope and hit you in the glove.”,She is also a self-described gym rat who has yet to come across someone who can outwork her.,“She lived two blocks from a gym, Lifetime Fitness, and when I’d call to pick her up for practice, she’d say, ‘Pick me up at Lifetime,’ ” recalled her AAU coach, Tara Starks. “And then, when practice was over, she’d want me to drop her off back at the gym.”,An incurable hoops junkie, she will watch NBA games if there are no college games on TV, and G League games if there are no NBA games. Asked if she ever detaches from basketball, she reacted with horror: “No. I can’t detach from family, and I can’t detach from basketball.”,And she is well-rounded: Though she considers herself a pass-first point guard (she’s tied for ninth in the country in assists per game), she is also shooting 53.9 percent from the field (tops among guards) and 47.4 percent from three-point range (third in the nation). McNutt compares her size and skills to Taurasi, arguably the best playmaker in WNBA history, and her handle to Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving. “She’s in an elite class of playmakers,” McNutt said.,But the true source of Bueckers’s greatness might be her court vision. Perhaps better than anyone in recent memory, she reads the constantly shifting geometry of basketball — the formations, the defensive shifts, the openings, the passing lanes — and reacts to it soonest and fastest, but never too soon or too fast, with precisely the correct pass, move or shot.,“She’s just built with unbelievable vision, to where she sees the floor two or three passes in advance,” said Brian Cosgriff, who, as Bueckers’s coach at Hopkins High in Minnetonka, Minn., bestowed the “Olive Oyl” nickname upon her. “When she’s bringing the ball down the floor, she’s seeing and reading where everyone else is on the floor, and she’s going to make the right read 99 percent of the time. You’re just born with that. You can’t teach it. You can’t practice it.”,Bueckers agreed that it is a skill she was born with.,“The biggest thing I take pride in is making my teammates around me better,” she said, “and, yeah, court vision has a lot to do with it: Just seeing things before they play out and being two or three steps ahead.”,Cosgriff compares that aspect of Bueckers’s game to Magic Johnson. Others have invoked names such as Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Draymond Green or even NFL legend Jim Brown — the latter comparison coming from the 66-year-old Auriemma.,“She takes her time,” Auriemma said. “. . . She’s like when Jim Brown used to run. When she gets the ball, she kind of [says]: ‘Should I [take] that hole, that one, that one? What’s the best decision for me right now?’ She waits until the absolute last minute, and nothing rushes her.”,Bueckers also has an intense competitiveness that can border on nasty. She has been known, on occasions when an opponent has gotten mouthy, to tell said opponent what is coming next — “I’m going to come off a screen to your right and hit a three in your face” — and then do it.,Lately, she has been hassling Auriemma about her playing time, complaining whenever he dares to take her out of a game. Late in one recent game, with the Huskies enjoying a comfortable lead and a teammate at the free throw line, she looked over at the scorer’s table, spotted a sub preparing to enter for her, and told the teammate to miss the free throw, so she might stay in.,“Then she came off and checked the stat sheet,” Auriemma recalled with feigned indignity, “and she goes, ‘You owe me two more minutes tomorrow, because I didn’t get to play my average [minutes].’ … I love her and everything, but there’s something not quite right about her.”,Auriemma, her teammates, anybody with the good sense to tune in and watch: We are all, in a way, Monica McNutt near the end of that South Carolina game, struggling to process what we are witnessing and asking ourselves a question,that might be partially answered over the next few weeks:,How does the legend grow from here?"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/19/dawn-staley-south-carolina-basketball-protest/,"Dawn Staley, another title in sight, won’t stop speaking out: ‘I can’t not do it’ ","At practice one afternoon in December, the South Carolina women’s basketball players spread out on a carpeted space away from the court. The university president wanted to talk to them.,Before games this season, most of the players, wanting to bring attention to systemic racism, had been sitting during the national anthem. Even with few fans in the arena, the act hadn’t gone unnoticed: ,, threats of boycott on Twitter and a Facebook rant describing the players as “unappreciative b----es” and suggesting their head coach be imprisoned as an American traitor.,But in Columbia, S.C., the team’s coach, Dawn Staley, will sooner get a court named after her than face serious blowback. Since her arrival in 2008, she has built a women’s basketball dynasty on Southern football turf, making nine straight , appearances, capturing six conference tournament championships and winning the national title in 2017. On Sunday, her team opens the tournament,as a No. 1 seed for the fifth time in the past eight years.,After winning that 2017 title, the state’s second-largest newspaper named Staley ,, ahead of Clemson football coach Dabo Swinney. The Republican governor once demanded an apology from a , who criticized Staley after a rowdy game at Columbia’s Colonial Life Arena. A South Carolina lawmaker recently introduced a , after her.,So when her players filled the socially distant chairs that afternoon, they could safely assume their coach would have their backs.,Still, this was South Carolina, where sitting for the anthem, as one Gamecocks alum told Staley in an email, is viewed by many as “despicable.”,The university president, Robert Caslen, is a retired Army lieutenant general. He told the players how he had sworn to defend the Constitution and supported their right for free speech, according to interviews with Caslen, Staley and players. He also mentioned how soldiers had died in his arms. He didn’t tell them what to do, but his background made it clear what ,does. He stands for the anthem.,Then, Staley, sitting beside her team, found herself doing what she had done all season. She began to speak up.,She had come home with scratched legs after battling all day with the boys. Staley, the smallest thing around the Raymond Rosen housing project in north Philadelphia, kept her mother worried but held her own on the basketball court. Near 23rd and Diamond streets, the intersection where she used to shoot jumpers at a crate fastened to a light pole, the sign now reads “Dawn Staley Lane.”,Staley brought her north Philly toughness and natural leadership to the University of Virginia. In the final seconds of overtime in the 1990 NCAA East Region final, Coach Debbie Ryan called a play, but Staley raised another idea. Virginia ran Staley’s play, and she drilled the midrange jumper, clinching the team’s first trip to the Final Four.,The next year, a teenage girl stood on the top ledge of a ,. The only person who could talk her down was her hero, Staley.,Staley started her coaching career in her hometown, at Temple University, but she moved in 2008 to South Carolina, where her mom was born and raised. Estelle Staley was a nice, churchgoing lady, Staley says, but one whose eyes you wouldn’t want to meet if you stole her parking spot at the mall.,“Oh, she ain’t letting them get away with it,” Staley says, laughing at the memory. “No, no, no! That window’s coming down.”,Staley is her mother’s daughter in that way. In her early days in Columbia, she went to the same local pizza place almost every day, tweeting love letters to her favorite pies. One day she and her family sat at an outdoor table. No one came to serve them, and the family felt mistreated. Miss Estelle wasn’t having it. They left.,Though her mother died in 2017, Staley hasn’t returned since. In the Book of Staley, right is right, and wrong is wrong.,“I grew up in a house like that,” she says. “There’s really no gray area.”,In Columbia, Staley inherited a program that hadn’t made the NCAA tournament in five years,and,averaged only 1,802 fans per game the season before she arrived. After her first home loss, as fans headed for the exits inside the nearly-empty gym, Staley searched for a microphone.,She urged everyone to stop walking. She thanked them for their loyalty and made them a promise: ,Twelve years later, they see her around campus, with a green tea-lemonade in hand, that Starbucks plastic stopper hanging from her mouth. Staley, 50, attends everything from softball games to welcome events for first-year Gamecocks. Students admire her. The bravest approach in awe and introduce themselves.,“Like she was Beyoncé,” says A’ja Wilson, the most decorated athlete in school history, who now plays for the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces.,Beyond campus, Staley has built a fiercely devoted following. In the six seasons before the pandemic, the Gamecocks led NCAA women’s basketball in attendance, averaging 12,185 fans during the 2019-20 season. Beyoncé has her Beyhive; Staley calls their superfans the “G-Hive.” After the title in 2017, fans got into a bidding war for the right to have the special edition, state-issued Gamecocks license plate, “WB 33” (the team went 33-4 that season). The queen of this hive rolls around in a matte black Mercedes-Benz SUV nicknamed “Michelle” after the former first lady, and her license plate reads, “WB 1.”,“When she came to the program, you could pick wherever you wanted to sit in the arena,” says Judi Gatson, a veteran newscaster in Columbia and avowed G-Hive member. “[Now] tickets to her program are the hottest ticket in the state.”,She has accomplished this with unapologetic Blackness at a school, in a state, that in many ways clings to its Whiteness. The Gamecocks won their 2017 title with an all-Black roster; only two years before, the Confederate battle flag still flew on the grounds of the South Carolina State House a few blocks away. The university erected a golden statue of Wilson outside the arena. But on this same campus, ,, a segregationist politician, remains.,Last summer, when a group of current and former athletes called a news conference in front of the fitness center, demanding a name change, Staley showed up to speak.,“, the head ball coach in South Carolina,” says Kayin Jones, executive director of Black Lives Matter South Carolina. “Being an African-American woman and really excelling in her craft … taking them to national prominence, she’s done a hell of a job. And in doing so, it has allowed her voice to be that much louder. Her bullhorn, she can turn the volume up on it.”,In May, Staley couldn’t keep up with her thumbs. Days after watching , die under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, her fingers pecked out her raw response, typos and all.,The tweet started Staley toward becoming one of the state’s most outspoken advocates for racial justice. She wrote an essay in the voice of a, woman. She hopped on Zoom calls with local reporters, knowing she was the only prominent Black coach at South Carolina to speak about Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in the back by a police officer in Kenosha, Wis.,“Activism has always been here,” U.S. Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) says of Columbia, the state capital. “It just hasn’t been very well known.” Staley, he says, is “reflective of that kind of attitude that’s been in Columbia for a long, long time.”,Her Twitter account was her biggest pulpit, and she has made a habit of going back at people, even if they identify themselves as Gamecocks fans. When a disgruntled fan claimed to be done with Staley after her support of Blake, she vowed to be herself: “,” It’s a strange sight, an SEC coach urging someone to get off her timeline, but ,. She delights in leaving trolls “at the altar,” as she calls it.,“I say what’s on my mind,” Staley says. “I can’t not do it. I can’t not post it because I don’t want to live with thinking that I should’ve said something and I didn’t.”,Staley knows she has upset some fans with her tweets and her takes on race in America. She knew there would be backlash, especially when all nine Black women on the team decided before the season to stage a silent protest.,The Gamecocks coaches, including Staley, and one White player typically stand for the anthem. The other White player, sophomore Olivia Thompson, started the season sitting with her teammates. Then, before the Dec. 3 game against North Carolina State, Thompson told Staley that sitting didn’t send a strong enough message for her. She wanted to take a knee.,“ ‘They’re going to tear her ass up.’ That’s what I said to myself,” Staley recalls. So before the anthem played, Staley walked over to Thompson, placed her right hand over her player’s shoulder and ,“A big thing with her is how she stands up for the people she cares about and the things she cares about,” Thompson says. “I feel like there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for us as players.”,Soon after that game, Caslen met with the team. He’s a fan of Staley — “She’s a national icon, and everybody loves her. When I get around her, I get a little nervous,” Caslen says — but he wanted to talk with her players about sitting for the anthem.,He maintained that their method wasn’t working with the people who needed to hear their message. Staley encouraged them to listen, but she also encouraged them to speak their minds, and they did.,After Caslen left, Staley addressed her team. She told them she wanted them to know the other side of the argument — to try to understand where people who shared Caslen’s views were coming from. She told them to take it all in.,But, like Caslen, she never told the players who had chosen to sit what to do. Before the next game, and every game since, they sat."

Cash will no longer be accepted, several popular concession stands and gathering places will be closed until further notice, and eating and drinking on the concourse will be prohibited.,An annual tour for media members at Nationals Park on Tuesday was different, too, with most of the focus on the health and safety protocols for 2021.,For April games, the Nationals gave season plan holders, with priority based on plan size and tenure, the opportunity to purchase tickets in pods of one to six seats. All pods will be at least six feet apart, with a maximum of three pods per row, and unavailable seats will be closed with zip ties. Suites will be opened at reduced capacities.,All fans 2 years and older are required to wear a face covering at all times inside the ballpark, except when eating and drinking in their pod. Approved face coverings include KN95, N95, cloth and surgical masks. Bandannas, gaiters and face coverings with exhalation valves are not permitted. Disposable face coverings will be available at Nationals Park gates for any fans who arrive without one. Fans who do not comply with the face covering policy will receive a verbal warning followed by potential removal from the ballpark.,All tickets will be digital and color-coded, corresponding to a designated gate to be used for entering and exiting the ballpark. All gates will open two hours before first pitch, and all parking garages will open 2½ hours before first pitch.,The Nationals, ,, have again updated their bag policy. Under the stricter rules, only clutch bags measuring seven inches long by five inches tall by three-fourths of an inch wide or smaller, diaper bags and bags used for medical reasons are permitted. Lockers will be available outside the home plate and right field gates to store bags for a fee. Fans are still permitted to bring outside food into the ballpark, but they’ll have to carry it in their hands. Scott Fear, the Nationals vice president of public safety and security, said the new policy was enacted to limit congestion at gates and will be revisited after the season.,Hand sanitizer dispensers and signs and decals about social distancing have been installed throughout the ballpark. All toilets and urinals have been converted to touchless flushing systems, and MERV 13 air filters have been installed in indoor spaces, including the redesigned Champions Club on the club level, where , sits in a glass display case in front of a mural celebrating that team.,In another effort to limit contact between guests and ballpark workers, cash will not be accepted at any parking, ticketing, retail or concession locations inside Nationals Park, except to purchase tickets for the 50/50 raffle. Fans who only have cash for other items may exchange it for eCash that may be used throughout the ballpark at the advance ticket sales booth, the Budweiser Terrace or at guest services by Section 131.,Fans are encouraged to download and use the MLB , to order concessions from their seats and pay for food and beverages at portable concession stands. Fans who place a mobile order on the app can opt in to receive a message when their order is ready and then retrieve their items using a dedicated pickup line. Standard lines will also be available for fans who choose not to mobile order, with payment options including Apple Pay, credit cards and debit cards. All food will be served in covered packaging, and touchless condiment dispensers have been installed throughout the ballpark.,The kids play area by the right field gate and the Budweiser Brewhouse will not be open in 2021. The Ultra Loft, formerly called the Bud Light Loft, and the Swing Big Beer Pen will be closed at the start of the season, but the Nationals plan to assign seats to those areas if and when the D.C. government allows more than 5,000 fans per game. The team said it is in conversations with the city to increase capacity, possibly as soon as the Nationals’ second homestand later in April.,The Budweiser Terrace bar beyond the center field scoreboard will be open, but all furniture has been removed to discourage fans from gathering around it before and during the game. The only place that fans are permitted to remove their mask to eat or drink is in their seating pod.,While some concession stands, including Medium Rare, See You Tater and Haute Dogs will not be open this season, the Nationals are introducing some new food options for 2021. Arepa Zone will be featured at the Avoiding Gluten stand in Center Field Plaza. Fuku, ,, will replace , by Section 238. Grazie Grazie, a , from Taylor Gourmet founder Casey Patten, will open by Section 114 with a menu featuring an Italian sandwich, a turkey sub and a caprese sandwich.,Baltimore-based Jimmy’s Famous Seafood will offer crab cake sandwiches and crab nachos in Sections 114, 140 and 306, and Taqueria del Barrio, which has a brick-and-mortar location in Petworth, will feature chicken tinga and barbacoa tacos in Sections 129, 216 and 314.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/31/washington-nationals-bold-predictions/,"Five preposterously positive Nats predictions, including a Juan Soto Triple Crown","After they finished below .500 for the first time since 2011 during last year’s shortened season, , as the Nationals open their 2021 season on Thursday against the New York Mets in D.C. Ahead of Opening Day, here are five preposterously positive Nationals predictions that probably won’t (but maybe will!) happen this year.,For starters, leading the league in batting average, home runs and RBI is one of the ,. Miguel Cabrera’s , for the Detroit Tigers in 2012 was MLB’s first Triple Crown campaign in 45 years. The last National Leaguer to do it was Joe Medwick of the St. Louis Cardinals … in 1937. If Soto bats , during spring training, his RBI opportunities could be limited.,Soto captured what’s referred to as the , during last year’s shortened season, leading the NL in batting average (.350), on-base percentage (.490) and slugging percentage (.695). Through three seasons, the 22-year-old’s numbers ,, who won the Triple Crown in 1942 and 1947. Who’s to say that Soto, who is projected to hit roughly 40 home runs this season, won’t continue to get better? “You never know,” , when asked in December about the possibility of adding a Triple Crown to his already impressive résumé. “Maybe. I hope so. I’m going to keep grinding, man. You never know.”,Robles registered a paltry four stolen bases in five attempts as part of his dreadful 2020 campaign, during which he hit .220 with a career-worst 28 percent strikeout rate. Robles had 28 steals in 37 attempts in 155 games the year before, a less-than-ideal success rate for anyone with hopes of reaching 40 steals.,Robles, who will turn 24 in May, shed some weight during the offseason and simplified his approach at the plate this spring. The early returns ,. If Robles can stay healthy and get on base at a better clip than the .293 on-base percentage he posted last season, he has the speed atop the order to join Trea Turner and Alfonso Soriano as the only Nationals players to eclipse 40 stolen bases in a season. (Nyjer Morgan finished with 42 steals in 2009, but 18 of those came before Washington acquired him in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates.),The only time a pair of Nationals players combined to hit at least 70 home runs was in 2009, when Adam Dunn (38) and Ryan Zimmerman (33) did it for a 103-loss team. Bell and Schwarber, two of Washington’s biggest offseason acquisitions, are coming off down years. Bell hit .226/.305/.364 with eight home runs in 57 games for the Pirates, while Schwarber hit a career-low .188/.308/.393 with 11 home runs in 59 games for the Chicago Cubs. Bell has hit only 18 home runs since the all-star break in 2019. Schwarber has never hit lefties well (.197/.301/.348).,They weren’t teammates at the time, but Bell and Schwarber hit 37 and 38 home runs, respectively, in 2019. The shortened 2020 season was so unusual that it’s not unreasonable to chalk up their performances to the small sample size and expect both 28-year-olds to bounce back in a big way. Most projection systems peg Bell and Schwarber to combine for roughly 60 dingers, so an additional 10 isn’t all that far-fetched. Both players have been locked in this spring.,The Nationals play in what figures to be ,, and most projection systems, including the one at FanGraphs, have them as the , in the NL East behind the Braves and Mets. On top of the question marks in the lineup and starting rotation, Washington’s defense will take a hit with Bell and Schwarber in the field. The Nationals have never won more than 98 games in a season.,Can Stephen Strasburg return to form after carpal tunnel surgery and stay healthy throughout the season? Will Max Scherzer, who will turn 37 in July, continue to defy age and revert to his pre-pandemic greatness? After posting a 4.66 ERA last year, can Patrick Corbin pitch more like the World Series hero who managed a 3.25 ERA in 2019? If the answer to all three of those questions is yes, Washington could run away with the division title. Jon Lester and Joe Ross make for a solid back end of the rotation, and the bullpen could be a strength of this team for a change. Speaking of …,The defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers return almost everyone from a bullpen that , in 2020. Washington’s 4.68 bullpen ERA was fourth worst in the National League last year. Will Harris is dealing with , that was originally believed to be a blood clot and will open the season on the injured list, free agent acquisition Brad Hand’s ,isn’t what it once was, and Tanner Rainey continues to work his way back from a muscle strain that cost him the first month of spring training.,Hand, who , with Washington, has a 2.70 ERA in 320 innings with San Diego and Cleveland since becoming a full-time reliever in 2016. Last year, he led the American League in saves (16) despite an average fastball velocity of 91.4 mph, which was down from his peak of 94 mph in 2018. Hand, who posted a career-best 7.25-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio last year, is expected to handle the closer role. Rainey allowed eight hits and struck out 32 in 20⅓ innings last season, and Wander Suero has looked dominant this spring. Daniel Hudson, who posted a 6.10 ERA last season, struggled in West Palm Beach, but the 34-year-old has a track record of success."

Trail by three with 37 seconds left, miss a free throw and get the offensive rebound. Tough it out in overtime. Proceed. Win two more, over a good BYU and a heady Abilene Christian. Come to another ditch, a last-ditch three-point shot by Alabama that looked like it might have blown the game for UCLA. Tough out that, too, in overtime.,Play Michigan in a inelegant but palpitating final. Take the beauty Michigan showed in its , and sap that beauty right out of the No. 1 seed. Force 14 turnovers to enable Cronin to say, “That’s huge, huge, guys. In a low-possession game, to create 14 turnovers, is really why we won.”,Then, use your evident and considerable gut to eke out of a game where the two teams miss 64 of 105 shots. Win despite getting outrebounded 38-28, getting outscored in the paint 32-16, seeing 7-foot Hunter Dickinson occasionally go dominant in the second half toward his 11 points. Hold Franz Wagner, the sophomore Michigan phenom, to 1-for-10 shooting, including two late three-point tries that never seemed to have much chance as they traveled.,And then, when your 34-25 lead has dissipated and the game has reached 46-46 with 5:22 to go on a loud three-point swish by Chaundee Brown, do something really impressive. Hold Michigan without a field goal from there.,That’s one curious trail to the Final Four, and now UCLA has taken it after finishing fourth in the Pac-12 and glum in the first half of March. “You’ve got to be able to win different ways,” said Cronin, 49, who used to assist Rick Pitino at Louisville and then head-coach Murray State and Cincinnati. So they had won all kinds of different ways just in this tournament, and they had ended the exhilarating run of Michigan and second-year coach Juwan Howard, who felt his first mad pain in his first turn at Madness.,“It’s going to be tough to sleep tonight, but I’ll get through it,” said Howard, whose team saw two decent looks in the last 3.8 seconds, including Mike Smith’s three-point try off a fine, full-court, inbounds play.,His team (23-5) had inched ahead in the game of inches, 47-46 with 4:30 left, when Dickinson made one free throw out of two. (His team had missed five of 11 free throws.) Then, across the balance, UCLA (22-9) had wrung a few baskets out of the great muck. With 4:04 left Jules Bernard, who had been fighting an injury lately, zipped across the lane from the left to set up a turnaround for a 48-47 lead. With 1:05 left, Juzang made a fine little challenged jumper from the baseline for a 50-47 lead.,That was it. That was all the Bruins needed in what Cronin called “a Big Ten battle-royale game,” in which, “Nobody could find an offensive rhythm and that was just a credit to the defenses,” in which it proved “hard to get bodies off of bodies.”,From that mire, from all the mire of the last two-plus weeks, here came UCLA, up the ladders to cut the nets, at a giddy vista along its wacky obstacle course. Wait, was that UCLA, in a 19th Final Four for the all-time royal program, yet so unlikely one might have to rub one’s eyes and check again? Apparently it was."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/gonzaga-beats-usc-elite-eight/,Gonzaga dominates the paint against Southern California and punches its ticket to the Final Four,"INDIANAPOLIS — The hope of the Southern California men’s basketball team resided directly beneath the basket. There, the Trojans desperately needed star freshman Evan Mobley to thrive. That was their path to the Final Four, an elite defensive performance that shuttered Gonzaga’s close-range efforts, and they had a soon-to-be NBA draft lottery pick manning that area.,Mobley shined throughout this season and in the NCAA men’s tournament, but in an Elite Eight matchup against the top-seeded Bulldogs, Gonzaga’s mustached sophomore with a headband, Drew Timme, quickly claimed that region as his territory. Southern California’s defense, with all its height and length, could do little to contain the prolific Gonzaga attack, and the Trojans crumbled on their way to an , Tuesday in the West Region final at Lucas Oil Stadium.,With Timme in the paint and freshman standout Jalen Suggs just about everywhere else, the Bulldogs continued their dominant run. On this night, they made it seem effortless, as though the sixth-seeded Trojans were just another opponent to breeze past. The Bulldogs (30-0) were never threatened as they powered their way to the Final Four. The program’s first national title stands just two wins away, with a semifinal scheduled for Saturday against No. 11 seed UCLA, which stunned top-seeded Michigan in the night’s final game. And so far this season, losing is a foreign concept to the Bulldogs.,“This is a heck of an accomplishment,” Coach Mark Few said. “We’re going to take it and savor it for what it is. That doesn’t lessen our desire to win this game, the next game or win two more games. We’re wise enough to know these are really, really special times.”,Gonzaga’s offense, facilitated skillfully by Suggs, proved again to be smooth and lethal. The Bulldogs didn’t commit their first turnover until only about a minute remained in the first half. By then, they had already made 19 baskets on 12 assists, good for 45 points and a monstrous lead. All evening, Southern California’s defense did little to disrupt Gonzaga’s flow.,Timme’s dominant presence down low led him to a team-high 23 points on 10-for-19 shooting. Corey Kispert and Suggs, with 18 points apiece, joined him in double figures. Kispert, a senior all-American, made three shots from deep and had a handful of other good looks that didn’t fall. Suggs, the star point guard, added eight assists and 10 rebounds, nearly recording a triple-double. Even with a second-half shooting performance that didn’t match the brilliance of the first, the Bulldogs delivered another complete outing.,“We were working together all night, not letting the ball get too sticky,” Suggs said. “We really did a good job, especially in the first half, in breaking that zone [defense] down.”,The Bulldogs finished with 46 points in the paint, fueled by Timme but with contributions from across the roster. The Trojans (25-8) didn’t block any shots, and they were outrebounded 41-29. The Bulldogs hardly needed help from three-point range — they hit 7 of 21 attempts — because of their assertiveness inside and an exquisite midrange game. Gonzaga had the best two-point field goal percentage in the country (63.9 entering this matchup), and USC had the best two-point defense (41.5 percent). When those two forces converged in the Elite Eight, the Bulldogs’ versatility won out.,“I know some people were worried about how he’s going to handle the size in there,” Few said of Timme. “But I think our staff and Drew and his teammates knew he was going to be fine. He’s faced many, many, many big lineups and shot blockers and such. He always figures out a way to get to his shot.”,Gonzaga’s defense, often the overlooked piece in its undefeated season, rattled the Trojans by forcing 10 turnovers and guarding the perimeter well. In Southern California’s three tournament wins, the Trojans shot better than 50 percent from long range. They made at least 10 three-pointers in their previous two victories, against Oregon and Kansas. Against the Bulldogs, the Trojans made only 4 of 15 attempts.,Less than five minutes into the game, Bert Smith, one of the officials, appeared to lose consciousness and fall to the court near the Gonzaga bench. He was immediately tended to by medical staff in a hushed arena. A few minutes later, Smith sat up and was alert. He left the arena sitting up on a stretcher, and play resumed with a standby referee joining the officiating crew. Smith didn’t need to be hospitalized, an NCAA spokesman said, and the players from both teams regrouped after the worrisome scene.,“I was just shocked and scared for him,” Few said. “But I was able to stick my head in there a little bit and see that he was talking and coherent and tried to say a quick prayer for him and wished him the best. Just told the guys we need to keep doing what we were doing prior to that.”,Southern California’s starting lineup is among the tallest in the nation, with four players at least 6-foot-7. The Trojans’ efforts on both ends of the floor are anchored by Mobley, a 7-foot freshman who led the team in scoring (16.4 points) and on the boards (8.7 rebounds). His brother, Isaiah, two years older and slightly shorter, reinforces the team’s effort in the paint with similar aptitude.,The Mobleys led the Trojans on Tuesday night — 17 points for Evan and 19 for Isaiah — but Southern California shot only 38.7 percent. The Trojans had no answers to Gonzaga’s poise and well-roundedness. Neither has any other opponent. With each performance, the gap between the Bulldogs and the field seems increasingly stark.,The Bulldogs have played in six consecutive Sweet 16s, and this year brought their fourth Elite Eight appearance in that stretch. Despite that run of dominance, Gonzaga had only made the Final Four once — in 2017, when , in the national title game. These Bulldogs, who have now won all 30 games this season and only once skated by with a single-digit margin, are gradually inching closer to what would be a perfect end to their already excellent season."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/03/30/south-carolina-beats-texas-elite-eight/,South Carolina jumps on Texas early and never lets up on its way to the Final Four,"SAN ANTONIO — Dawn Staley and Vic Schaefer are used to glancing down the sideline and seeing the other in high-stakes situations. When Schaefer was at Mississippi State, the two coaches faced off in four SEC tournament championship games and in the ,.,They were at it again Tuesday, with Schaefer at the helm of No. 6 seed Texas and a trip to the Final Four on the line. Staley and top-seeded South Carolina won all five of those previous meetings and were superior again in the Elite Eight, never trailing in a , to advance to the third Final Four in program history and the first since winning it all in 2017.,The Hemisfair Region champion will face Stanford on Friday with a spot in the national championship game on the line. The other side of the NCAA women’s tournament , is already set with No. 1 seed Connecticut facing No. 3 seed Arizona.,“I’ve told [Staley], it seems like when we play them, their defense is always on point and rises to the occasion,” Schaefer said. “They always play extremely, extremely hard on that end. I thought today they were spectacular. It’s hard to win, hard to be competitive … there was three minutes to go in the third quarter and we don’t score again.,“It wasn’t just that. … They came out and punched us.”,South Carolina guard Zia Cooke put pressure on the Texas defense all night with her speed and ability to knife through defenders. She finished with 16 points, six rebounds and three assists. Victaria Saxton got loose early and contributed 12 points and eight rebounds. Destanni Henderson added 12 points and seven assists, while national player of the year candidate Aliyah Boston had a quiet 10 points and eight rebounds after averaging a double-double during the regular season and postseason.,Boston and the South Carolina defense made life extremely difficult on second team all-American Charli Collier of Texas, who finished with just four points on 2-for-10 shooting and four rebounds. Audrey Warren led the , (21-10) with 13 points and five rebounds. Texas never found any kind of offensive rhythm as it shot just 23 percent (14 for 61) from the field and 20 percent (3 for 15) from beyond the arc. Nearly every shot was contested and the Gamecocks (26-4) recorded 14 blocks, including nine from Laeticia Amihere (10 points, eight rebounds).,“We were just locked in,” Staley said. “We were a team that was driven to be where we are right now. They wanted to go to the Final Four. They want to win a national championship, and they’re going to give it up on both sides of the ball.,“I thought it was a pretty good defensive performance. But I also think Texas was a little tired. They gave every single thing they had in that Maryland game [in the previous round]. … We just never let them off the hook. That’s the kind of approach you have to take, especially when you’re playing against a Vic Schaefer team and the performance that they had two nights ago.”,South Carolina sprinted out to a 14-2 lead as Texas fell into an early hole for the second consecutive round — Maryland led 9-0 before ultimately losing to the Longhorns ,. Not only did the Gamecocks get off to a quick start, but each of their first seven baskets came off layups — including four in a row from Saxton — as the vaunted Texas defense looked out of sorts on the interior. A layup before the buzzer from Texas guard Kyra Lambert helped salvage the first quarter and cut the South Carolina lead to 18-7.,A midrange jumper and a banked-in runner from Cooke pushed the lead to 22-9, but Texas finally found its footing and began defending the interior more effectively. Texas guard Celeste Taylor led an 8-2 run that cut the lead to 24-17, and it looked as if the Longhorns were about to put together another come-from-behind effort. But the positive vibes didn’t last long.,“We haven’t started well for the past two games,” Lambert said. “After the first quarter, we were just trying to regroup, get it together on the defensive end. Credit to South Carolina. I mean, they played a great ballgame. They guarded us like we like to guard. It just wasn’t our night.”,Cooke continued to bury pull-up jumpers, and South Carolina went on a 13-2 run highlighted by another Saxton layup off a laser pass from Henderson. A three-pointer from Warren before time expired made things look a bit more respectable, but the Gamecocks still took a 37-22 lead into halftime after a dominant opening 20 minutes.,The Longhorns produced one more push in the third quarter with a 9-0 run to cut the lead to 41-31, but Texas never got within single digits the rest of the way. Staley’s crew closed the quarter on an 11-3 stretch capped by a fast-break, reverse layup from Cooke that drew gasps from the crowd and gave the Gamecocks a 52-34 advantage after three quarters.,South Carolina was so dominant that it didn’t allow a point in the final 10 minutes, the first time a team has gone scoreless in a quarter in the , since the women’s games switched to a four-quarter format in 2015.,“It’s very surreal for me,” Cooke said. “I was out there and just staring. I’m really here, really going to the Final Four. But I feel like our work isn’t done yet. I don’t want to get my hopes up too high because we still have two games to go, but I’m ready for it.,“We just played with our guard up. We knew that Texas was a good defensive team. Can’t take any team lightly. Maryland was supposed to win that game, but they didn’t. Same for this game. We were supposed to win, but it could have went the other way. We just made sure we put our foot on the gas, kept our guard up and did what we needed to do.”"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/wizards-hornets/2021/03/30/cd6ffeda-9183-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html,"Rui Hachimura steps to the forefront, but it’s not enough as the Wizards fall to the Hornets","A mundane floater in the lane was what did it for Rui Hachimura as the second-year pro took a step forward in his career. There was no celebration from the typically stone-faced 23-year-old as he tied his career high in points — the Wizards trailed late in the fourth quarter, after all — just a jog back down the court.,Washington lost, 114-104, to the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday night at Capital One Arena, but if there is one thing the Wizards could take from a game in which the odds were stacked high against them from the start, it is that Hachimura seems to be coming into his own at last.,On another night without Bradley Beal, who was out for the second straight game with a right hip contusion, Hachimura stepped up alongside Russell Westbrook, leading the Wizards with 30 points. Not even counting center Thomas Bryant, who is out for the season with a torn ACL, the Wizards (17-29) were down five players, so Hachimura stepped into a starring role.,His strong performance wasn’t just for lack of other options, though; the forward has been hard-charging for some time. He entered Tuesday’s game averaging 17.5 points, shooting 52.3 percent, converting 39.4 percent from three-point range and pulling in 7.3 rebounds in 11 games since the all-star break — a considerable bump in production after an injury-laden start to the season. He attributed his uptick to two things: playing with more force on offense and Westbrook’s tutelage.,“Just [being] aggressive, especially offensively,” he said. “Even defense. . . . I can guard one through five, so I’ve just got to keep doing it. Hopefully we’ll start winning games.”,Hachimura was just as active against the Hornets (24-22) as he was against the Indiana Pacers in a win the night before, making 12 of 25 shots from the field before ceding the spotlight to Westbrook in the fourth quarter as the Wizards trailed by single digits.,“Rui, I’m telling you, he’s coming along. He still has a few more levels of getting better, and that’s the thing I love about him,” Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said. “. . . We’re going to see him become really like a high-, high-level player because he’s just learning how to play smaller players on the defensive end.”,For much of the night, it was Westbrook who set up Hachimura. The same point guard who sat during back-to-backs in the first half of the season had his second triple-double in as many nights. He followed Monday’s historic performance (35 points, 21 assists and 14 rebounds) with 22 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists Tuesday for his league-leading 17th triple-double of the season.,Westbrook is the third player in NBA history to have consecutive games with at least 20 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists. Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson are the others, both achieving their feats in the 1960s.,But Hachimura, Westbrook and three other double-digit scorers weren’t enough to keep Charlotte at bay after a superb start by Gordon Hayward, who had 26 points. Terry Rozier scored 27 as the Hornets shot 46.7 percent overall and 41.2 percent from three-point range, picking on the Wizards’ perimeter defense all night.,“They have a lot of guys who can score,” Hachimura said. “. . . They made tough shots, but also if they missed, when they missed, we didn’t get rebounds. We just gave up second chances; that’s what hurt us. We’ve got to be more solid. All the young guys, we’ve got to step up more, especially defensively.”,The Wizards’ scoring options were slim Tuesday after Washington added another player to its injured ranks: Backup point guard Raul Neto, who has been dealing with a left rib contusion for a few weeks but hadn’t missed a game, joined Beal, backup point guard Ish Smith (quadriceps) and forward Davis Bertans (right calf strain) on the sideline.,Recently acquired center Daniel Gafford was out, too, with a right high ankle sprain after a fall in Monday’s game. Gafford had an MRI exam Tuesday and will be reevaluated in approximately 10 days.,With the Wizards’ guard numbers thinning, rookie Cassius Winston, who is on a two-way contract and spent time in the G League bubble this season, played 11 minutes and scored three points. But it was center Robin Lopez who shined off the bench, turning in 16 points and 11 rebounds.,

For me, it’s the spring,” Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III said Tuesday. “If we can open in May, that would be great. It might be early June.”,His top priority is the safety of staff and visitors, Bunch said. “We are always looking at the numbers, and they are rising a little bit,” he said.,The Smithsonian closed its buildings in November as cases began to spike in the region. When they are ready to reopen this spring, they will mimic last summer’s multiphased approach, Bunch said, with the National Zoo one of the first to come back. The phased reopening will be faster than last time, when it took two months to open eight sites.,“We won’t need as much time,” he said. “Every Friday, we could do a few more.”,The National Gallery of Art also predicts a spring opening of both its West and East buildings, according to Director Kaywin Feldman. The West Building reopened for several months last year, while the East Building remained closed for construction. The gallery’s outdoor sculpture garden, and the Smithsonian gardens, are open.,“We don’t want to reopen and reclose again,” Feldman said Tuesday. “We are watching lots of data. We are being very cautious. As I said all along, the top priority is the health and safety of our visitors and staff.”,The museum is taking its cues from the Biden administration, which is sounding the alarm about ,, Feldman said. Nationally, coronavirus cases have increased 13 percent, with the seven-day average of new cases exceeding 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, according to Washington Post data. The city’s cases have increased, too.,“That caution is directing our considerations,” Feldman said.,Meanwhile, Planet Word, Glenstone and the National Building Museum have announced plans to bring visitors back over the next week. They join the already-open Museum of the Bible, the International Spy Museum, the National Museum of Women in the Arts and the Phillips Collection.,reopens Thursday on a reduced schedule, a decision that is based on the region’s health data and the return of many community organizations, said Executive Director Patty Isacson Sabee.,“The whole community is moving forward to open up,” Sabee said. “As more people are vaccinated, there’s a sense of optimism. It’s spring break, and people are having the ability to get out and experience things more.”,Like the other sites, Planet Word will limit capacity and require masks and social distancing. With just 200 guests admitted between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., Sabee said, “we will be able to maintain a safe way to experience the museum.”,The ,will be open Friday through Sunday starting April 9.

You can feed your spirit and soul. Maybe now more than ever we all realize how critical and central art is to our lives.”,The reopening of the city’s museums is also critical to Washington’s comeback, said Elliott Ferguson, president and chief executive of ,, a nonprofit supporting Washington tourism. But the Smithsonian is the most important.,“It is extremely important that those museums are open, but the perception is still tied to what happens with the Smithsonians,” Ferguson said. “We are extremely excited about those that are open. We want the zoo and the other Smithsonians to open.”,Feldman, the National Gallery’s director, said the experience gained from the summer and fall will make a spring reopening easier.,“Within about two weeks, we’ll be able to organize and have everything in place,” Feldman said, referring to timed tickets and such safety protocols as masking, social distancing and managing traffic flow.,“Everyone is eager to come back, eager to experience art and that togetherness and a sense of normalcy,” she said. “I had hoped [to reopen] mid-March, and that didn’t happen. I do believe it’s getting really close.”,

But then their third-period ghosts come back to haunt them again.,The New York Rangers scored four times in the third period to complete a run of five unanswered goals and claim a 5-2 victory at Madison Square Garden.,""Tonight I just thought we were inconsistent,"" Capitals Coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We had guys that were not on the mark. Big mistakes. I thought we did fly-bys on too many pucks. We didn't compete hard enough on the pucks, turnovers, turned pucks over and big chances back in the different direction."",Washington's winning streak ended at three, but the Capitals (23-8-4, 50 points) still sit atop the East Division. Washington will face the New York Islanders, who are tied for second place with Pittsburgh with 48 points, twice during this five-game road trip — including in its next game Thursday night.,But Tuesday, the Capitals again were unable to put together a complete game, a lingering issue for this veteran team. The Rangers nearly completed a comeback from a 4-0 third-period deficit Sunday in Washington, but the Capitals held on for a 5-4 victory.,""We've just got to find a way to put 60 minutes together,"" defenseman Zdeno Chara said. ""I think most of those games we didn't put 60 minutes together, even the games that we won. For example, the last game at home, we won the game, but I don't think we have had a full 60-minute game that we wanted to play. They took over in the third period."",After a sleepy second period produced no goals and kept Washington ahead by one, the third became a battle between Capitals rookie goalie Vitek Vanecek and Rangers counterpart Igor Shesterkin. Shesterkin (30 saves) emerged victorious; Vanecek (22 saves) couldn't make the key saves down the stretch.,The third period was all Rangers. Kaapo Kakko tied the score at 2 at 4:10 with a goal that capped a pretty passing sequence on the rush. Just over two minutes later, defenseman Adam Fox put the Rangers ahead with a nifty backhander for the eventual game-winner at 6:32. Artemi Panarin delivered an insurance goal with 4:19 left after he got behind the Capitals' defense and beat Vanecek on a breakaway. Pavel Buchnevich had an empty-netter at 19:25 to seal the win.,""We've got to find a way to be able to finish these games and play stronger defensively, making stronger plays and really taking a pride in our defense and be able to finish and find a way to win these games,"" Chara said.,Winger T.J. Oshie and fourth-line center Nic Dowd had put the Capitals ahead early. Oshie scored his ninth goal with a one-timer from the slot on the power play only 2:23 in. He was in discomfort on the bench late in the game after taking a cross-check, but Laviolette had no update on his status.,Dowd gave the Capitals a 2-0 lead by scoring his seventh goal in 35 games — matching his output from 56 games last season — by hammering home the puck during a scramble in front at 4:22.,New York got its first goal after a bad turnover by Capitals defenseman Dmitry Orlov at the left point in the Rangers' zone. Filip Chytil stole the puck and raced down the ice for a clean breakaway, putting it past Vanecek at 15:36 of the first.,Washington was lucky to escape the period without further damage. Panarin had two high-danger power-play chances, with one shot hitting the crossbar.,Capitals center Lars Eller returned to the lineup Tuesday after missing seven games with a lower-body injury he suffered March 13. Eller said Tuesday morning that he suffered a setback ""in a different area"" last week that stalled his return.,""I had a setback, plain and simple,"" he said. ""As we progressed and I felt better and better, I just had a step backward and we had to settle down, rest again and then slowly progress one more time."",With Eller back,  Laviolette scratched Richard Panik and kept Daniel Sprong in the lineup. Sprong was not a regular to start the season, but he suited up for his 24th game Tuesday; he has six goals and four assists. Sprong, acquired at the trade deadline last year for defenseman Christian Djoos, filled in when forward Tom Wilson was out of the lineup during his seven-game suspension and then kept his spot in the lineup with Eller's injury.,Tuesday was Panik's first time out of the lineup this season. He has three goals and six assists in 34 games, but Laviolette has applauded his defensive abilities as well as his physical play.,""It comes down to tough decisions,"" Laviolette said. ""Richard was the odd man out today, and I think that when you are evaluating everything, you got to put yourself in a position to stay in the lineup."",

To these can be added climate disasters, humanitarian crises, terrifying gun atrocities and our nation’s increasing political discord. All are deeply serious matters, most needing energetic attention right now.,Yet knowing this, even the most activist among us will occasionally grow weary from the daily onslaught of angst. Is there no refuge, however temporary, from our brutal zeitgeist? Far too rarely does contemporary fiction and nonfiction provide the needed escape, regularly being gloomy, earnest and replete with finger-pointing and breast-beating.,At the risk of sounding unduly flippant, I want to put in a good word for books that contribute to what Samuel Johnson called “the gaiety of nations” and “the public stock of harmless pleasure.” I’m talking about wholly frivolous comic fiction.,For many readers, the first and foremost proponent of the subgenre is P.G. Wodehouse, whose accounts of upper-class twits effervesce with smile-inducing similes: “She came leaping towards me, like Lady Macbeth coming to get first-hand news from the guest-room.” Almost as well known among connoisseurs are E.F. Benson’s Mapp and Lucia novels (starting with “,”) and such humorous masterpieces as Jerome K. Jerome’s “,,” Anita Loos’s “,,” the immortal “,,” and Stella Gibbons’s “,,” which features, among its many other pleasures, old Ada Doom’s eerie, never-explained catchphrase: “I saw something nasty in the woodshed.” Still, there are many other, less familiar examples of delightfully inconsequential fiction, and one of the best is “,,” by the prolific J. Storer Clouston. It’s a perfect April Fools’ Day treat.,First published in 1899, but now available in a modern edition (McSweeney’s/The Collins Library), “The Lunatic at Large” opens at Clankwood, which “bore the enviable reputation of containing the best-bred lunatics in England.” One night, under mysterious circumstances, a new inmate, apparently named Francis Beveridge, is delivered to the asylum. Though suffering from amnesia, he turns out to be unflappably polite, irresistibly charming and quite frisky with the nurses. Think of Peter O’Toole in the film “My Favorite Year.”,Inevitably, Beveridge — who clearly isn’t deranged or in any way threatening — escapes from Clankwood and makes his way to London, where he shaves off his beard and mustache and assumes the new last name of Bunker. In need of funds, he rapidly ingratiates himself with a visiting German aristocrat, the rich, kindly and naïve Baron Rudolf von Blitzenberg, whose titles include that of “hereditary carpet-beater to the Bavarian Court.”,The lonely Baron yearns for excitement, and this his imaginative companion readily provides, one madcap or mildly risque escapade following another, culminating in the German being mistaken for a bomb-throwing anarchist. At this point, the two friends quickly repair to the holiday resort of St. Egbert’s-on-Sea.,There the Baron meets and falls in love with the beautiful Lady Alicia, which causes some temporary difficulties since she had earlier assisted the erstwhile Beveridge with breaking out of Clankwood. Aiming to advance his friend’s suit, Bunker suggests that the infatuated nobleman pretend to fall seriously ill. During a sickroom visit by Alicia and her mother, Lady Grillyer, the latter suspiciously demands, “ ‘What is the matter with the Baron?’,“Mr. Bunker saw that there was nothing for it but heroic measures.,“ ‘The dog was destroyed at once,’ he replied, with intense gravity. ‘It is therefore impossible to say exactly what is the matter.’,“ ‘The dog!’ cried the two ladies together.,“ ‘By this evening,’ he continued, ‘we shall know the worst — or the best.’ ”,Needless to say, such a smooth operator is never at a loss, even when he finally regains his memory and discovers his true identity.,Because Clouston’s book so enchanted me, I quickly acquired battered copies of its first three sequels, “Count Bunker” (1905), “,” (1922) and “The Lunatic Still At Large” (1924). Here’s a teaser for “Count Bunker.”,Five years have passed, and a somewhat plumper Baron von Blitzenberg returns to London as an attaché to the German Embassy. While happy in his marriage to Alicia, the Baron sighs for a little more fun in his life. He consequently dines secretly with his old friend Bunker and, through that trickster’s baleful influence, soon finds himself in a Scottish castle, passing himself off as its new laird, Lord Tulliwuddle. What of his Teutonic accent? A fashionable affectation, honoring the royal family’s German origins.,Before long, the Baron, assisted by “Count Bunker,” must confront not only the spectral Wraith of the Tulliwuddles but also the double temptation of a romantic highland beauty and an alluring American heiress. Meanwhile, back in London, the formidable Lady Grillyer arrives for a visit with her daughter. As Clouston reminds us, “this paragon among mothers and peeresses was a lady of majestic port, whose ascendant expression and commanding voice were commonly held to typify all that is best in the feudal system; or, in other words, to indicate that her opinion had never been contradicted in her life.” When Alicia explains that the Baron is away on a secret diplomatic mission, Lady Grillyer quickly concludes that something fishy is going on.,I’ll stop there. Rest assured, however, that Clouston unites all his characters in a frantic, Keystone Kops-like finale, with marriage vows intact and no hearts broken. On his last page, his two scapegrace heroes duly toast each other and “a creed even merrier than Socialism, more convivial than Total Abstinence, and more perfectly designed for human needs than Esperanto — the gospel of ‘Cheer up.’ ” These days, we can all drink to that.,

But that’s only scratching the surface.","None of the faces in Faith Ringgold’s “Four Women at a Table” expresses any joy. The women are clustered into a tight space, shadows fall deeply on their hair and faces, and if the two figures on either side of the table are looking at each other, it is with suspicion or some darker insinuation.,The 1962 painting, an early work by the acclaimed artist, is encountered at the beginning of a powerful survey of her career on view at the Glenstone Museum. Originally presented in 2019 at the Serpentine Galleries in London, the show traveled to Sweden and is seen here in its only U.S. venue. Bringing outside exhibitions isn’t Glenstone’s usual practice, says museum director Emily Wei Rales. But even before the death of , last summer, and the catalytic effect that had on the Black Lives Matter movement, Glenstone had made plans to host the show.,Seeing it today, while a trial examining Floyd’s death is underway in Minneapolis, is brutally hard, but also exhilarating. Ringgold emerges not just as a powerful advocate for racial justice and the equality of women, but as a prophet. And seeing a cross-section the 90-year-old artist’s career leaves one thrilled by something,else as well: the cohesiveness and persistence of her ideas, impulses and gestures, which suggests a heroic sense of purpose, a mind dedicated to gathering things up, binding them together and making them legible to as wide an audience as possible.,Consider “Four Women at a Table.” There is a narrative here, apparently one of idleness, alienation and mutual distrust, though the picture doesn’t make it explicit. But there is also a tendency to foreground geometries that carry emotional weight, the angles and arcs of looking at or past one another, and the hierarchies of height and placement of the faces within a confined frame. The heads owe something to Picasso and even more to the abstracting lines and planes of Matisse, whose green facial shadows seem to have inspired Ringgold to create analogous blue ones in these first years of her career.,Throughout the exhibition, this tendency to geometry and abstraction recurs, connecting figurative work to occasional forays into pure abstraction. Ringgold, who was raised in Harlem and supported the Black Power movement in the 1960s, is remembered in the reductive shorthand of the casual museumgoer as a political artist, and a provocative one. The display of one of her most bracing works, the 1967 “American People Series #20: Die” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York both honors and attenuates that legacy of activism: The wall-size painting is juxtaposed with Picasso’s revolutionary 1907 “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon,” with the implicit suggestion that both are disruptive, spontaneous and wild in their tenacity of expressive purpose.,But that minimizes another fact about Ringgold which becomes increasingly clear throughout this exhibition: the highly plotted and structured forms that underlie every painting or design. She is passionate about composition, making it a metaphor for understanding and thereby containing the energies her art depicts and deploys. One of her best-known works, the 1967 “American People #19: US Postage Stamp Commemorating the Advent of Black Power,” uses the Pop Art trope of a familiar, everyday object, the postage stamp, to create a grid of faces, some Black, the others mostly White. The words “Black Power” are inscribed diagonally across the grid, clearly legible. But the grid itself is structured by the words “White Power,” with the letters distended and connected, and rendered in white, and thus almost impossible to read unless you are looking for them.,The ghostly, grid-like font makes a basic statement about the hidden nature of power structures, a ubiquity and omnipresence that makes them disappear within the implied natural order of things. But it also recalls a children’s game, in which words were written with characters stretched out vertically, such that the only way you could read them was to turn the paper so that it was almost horizontal to the floor, which made the vertically distended font appear like normal print.,This game offers a simple lesson in a basic artistic skill, foreshortening. In Ringgold’s hand, it also suggests that we should, at least mentally, take her paintings off the wall if we want to see things from a new angle. That demand becomes even more explicit in her famous quilt paintings, in which the lettering on some of the quilted canvases scrolls around the work geometrically such that it is sometimes upside down, or running up and down the vertical axis. Again, the best way to see this, to read it easily, would be to remove it from the wall — if that kind of thing was allowed in an art museum.,Ringgold turned to making her quilt paintings after discovering a room of 15th-century Tibetan and Nepalese scroll paintings, or tankas, at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Paintings that could be rolled up were easier to move and store, which she found convenient at the time. “As a woman artist, you have to manage your work itself,” she said in an interview with Hans Ulrich Olbrist published in the forthcoming exhibition catalogue.,One could fill out a good-size dissertation on Ringgold’s quilt works alone ,how they made storytelling and memory central to her work, allowing her to bypass the usual gatekeepers of narrative, and how they confounded old ideas about the line between art and craft, painting and quilting, legitimate and marginalized forms of expression. What strikes one most powerfully seeing them again, and so many of them all at once, is their intimacy. One virtue of things that are highly portable is that you can keep them close to you, and it is that quality of closeness that is most moving.,Among the exhibition highlights is the display for the first time in one gallery of a collection of nine abstract works Ringgold made in the early 1980s, after the 1981 death of her mother. She calls these paintings the Dah series, a made-up name given to them by her first granddaughter, who was learning to speak at the time. Formally, they build on the nearly abstract rendering of forests and greenery seen in some of her earlier works. The patterning also suggests the kind of camouflage we might wear if we were trying to remain inconspicuous in a forest of rainbows, silver and gold, and perpetual sunsets. They suggest paradise, or joy, perhaps the elation of discovery when a child points out something meaningful and says, simply, “that,” “there,” “yes” or “dah!”,The value of this exhibition is its accumulation of detail and insight. It doesn’t argue that Ringgold’s art is somehow more personal and intimate than we usually give it credit for, if only we could see past the politics. Rather, it adds the personal and the intimate to the activist and politically attuned sensibility. It connects the twists and turns in her life — a visit to see the Dutch masters at the Rijksmuseum leads to the discovery of tanka paintings — to her lifelong passion about justice in the world.,But it also offers something that is easy to lose sight of, the utopian “after” of political struggle. What does the better world we seek look like, when we achieve it?,The Dah series suggests it is already there, hiding in plain sight, like the pernicious words “White Power” on the postage-stamp painting she made in 1967.,

Framed as an oral history, “,” relies on a collage of voices to tell the story of Opal Jewel and Nev Charles, artists who got their start as an interracial duo in the ‘70s. Their first album was struggling when a violent tragedy drew the spotlight to them. That moment of fame as a duo was short-lived — Nev, “a goofy white English boy,” turned to more commercially popular music and sailed to solo superstardom; Opal, “an outcast Black girl from Detroit” with more experimental ambitions, has a quieter but singular career as a foremother of Afropunk whose iconic moments tend to resurface as memes.,A reunion tour promises to bring the two performers together for the first time in decades, but the personal, racial and political tensions that haunted the label and the country when they debuted haven’t gone anywhere. Walton brilliantly uses the unfolding story of the present to unspool the hidden story of the past.,Though Nev is in the title, the novel is most concerned with two women: Opal herself and SarahLena “Sunny” Curtis, the entertainment journalist who has been granted access to tell Opal’s story. Sunny’s interest in Opal isn’t purely journalistic — Sunny’s father, Jimmy, was murdered in the incident that jump-started Opal’s and Nev’s careers, and Sunny knows that Opal was having an affair with him. Opal has been a presence in Sunny’s life from the beginning: a beacon, a ghost, a void where her father might have been. “My most complicated idol,” Sunny calls her.,How wonderful it is to watch Walton build that complexity, starting with Opal’s fraught music industry debut. Opal arrives in New York facing the skepticism of the label executive who had hoped Nev would choose her buxom and more conventionally attractive sister, Pearl, as his vocal partner. Opal is skinny and dark-skinned and, because of alopecia, spent her childhood being taunted by kids who called her baldie. She’s never been taught to read music and doesn’t know much about the world she’s entering, but she knows she wanted out of her old life, and that’s all the motivation she needs. With the help of her stylist Virgil, who sees her unusual looks as a canvas for otherworldly drama, and Jimmy, her drummer and lover, who teaches her how to hear and adapt their music, she becomes a bolder, more authoritative presence. Opal is justifiably touchy when asked repeatedly about that confidence: “I understand that what people are really trying to ask me is this: ‘How in the world did a woman so black and so ugly manage to believe she could be somebody?’ ”,Opal’s confidence is hard-won and triumphant, but it’s also connected to the messier things that make her a fascinating fictional character rather than a martyr. Opal can be selfish, defensive and oblivious to what gets lost in pursuit of her own ambition or desire. The fake-documentary format gives Virgil’s and Pearl’s voices room to shine and sometimes gently push back against Opal’s story of how she invented herself. The relative absence of Jimmy’s voice — he died before anyone cared enough about Opal & Nev to document his thoughts on either of them — accumulates weight as the story continues without him. It is refreshing to read a book that centers a Black woman who has this many layers, a book that seeks neither to save her from nor punish her for the flaws that make her human.,At times, I held my breath, wondering if the novel could sustain its tightrope act — balancing its array of voices, its fictional history with actual history, its affection for Opal with the clarity of its portrait of her, its interest in Sunny herself with the story Sunny purportedly set out to tell. The first half of the book builds to a fuller account of the climactic event in the story’s past, and I wondered whether there would be enough narrative momentum left for the second half. I worried that Sunny’s own arc, primarily focused on the challenges of being the first Black editor of Aural, a legacy music publication, might start to feel sidelined or extraneous, given that it appeared only in editorial notes between the chapters.,I should have had faith: Walton structured this book masterfully. Halfway through, a major revelation about the past shifts the narrative question to the present, brilliantly spotlighting how salient history remains in a country that has never fully reckoned with racism or held its perpetrators accountable. Once we learn what happened, the book can turn its full attention to what happens next. Sunny’s professional circumstances shift, creating personal tension between Sunny and Opal, and a fascinating thematic echo in the story of two successful Black women whose power involves a balancing act between White approval and their own integrity. Even in 2016, the freedom available to Black women seeking to do things on their own terms has its price.,My only real disappointment with “The Final Revival of Opal & Nev” is that when I finished reading, I had to remind myself that Opal Jewel was fictional, and I couldn’t search the archives for her interviews, read more biographies, listen to her entire musical catalogue, and tell everyone I know to do the same. Still, I am grateful for this fictional account, which gives readers the chance to meet an unforgettable character and also provides a lens for considering the real-world artists whose stories have not yet been told in a way that centers them or gives them proper credit.,

Seemingly almost in opposition to this imagery, however, many Syrian artists have responded by creating work that is extraordinarily diverse, aesthetically rich and at times even beautiful, as a new group art show at the Middle East Institute makes clear.,“In This Moonless Black Night: Syrian Art After the Uprising” is the first significant exhibition in Washington to focus on contemporary art by Syrians. It features 14 artists, half of them women; the majority have not previously been shown in D.C. All are living in exile, whether in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the Arab world; most left Syria at some point after the uprising that began in March 2011, although a few were living abroad already.,The uprising and what followed “kind of saw an upsurge in creativity,” according to curator Maymanah Farhat, speaking during a live-streamed preview of the exhibition. “There was a sort of release. I think with being in exile, artists have really allowed themselves to experiment.”,Themes of displacement and migration appear as a through line in multiple works, among the most immediate of which is Essma Imady’s installation “Pillar of Salt,” consisting of a child’s tiny pink backpack and teddy bear resting atop what the work’s label describes as a child’s weight in salt. While at first appearing as a simple cluster of everyday objects, it poignantly references the refugee crisis and in particular its impact on women and children.,In a recent webinar hosted by the gallery, the artist, who has interviewed Syrians in the United States and Canada about their experiences, said the installation was inspired by the concept of “looking back and being turned into a pillar of salt — how us refugees . . . have this pulling to look back, while also feeling the danger of that action.”,Four pieces by Mohamad Hafez, who was trained and has worked as an architect, feature extremely realistic, almost ­diorama-like re-creations of homes or street scenes set inside open suitcases, like miniature windows onto those worlds. Some of these “Baggage” pieces are named after and based on the lives of specific refugees to the United States who have told Hafez their stories.,“Ayman and Ghina,” which shows an elegant, blue-tinted living room, complete with a coffee table set with china, is inspired by a family from Homs who left home at a moment’s notice when they learned the army was just outside their village.,“I decided to model their living room because the day they escaped, they were in their living room, having breakfast,” Hafez says by phone from his home in Connecticut. “They left breakfast on the table. They thought they would be back in a few hours . . . and it’s been eight years now, or nine years.”,Other works grapple with migration more abstractly, such as Khaled Barakeh’s “I Haven’t Slept for Centuries.” What at first appears to be a jumble of dark black lines on a white background is in fact a digital print of superimposed visas, passport entry and exit stamps, and rejected applications to visit various countries — all personally accumulated by the artist, in a bleak commentary on the bureaucratic indignities faced by those in the Syrian diaspora.,The exhibition’s wide range — in media, form, content and tone — also highlights the country’s rich visual culture and how it has influenced its artists. Two mixed-media pieces by Bady Dalloul incorporate intricately painted old wooden gaming boards that call to mind the designs of traditional Islamic tiles or inlay. Photographs by Osama Esid of the interiors of refugee tents in camps in Turkey, lined with patterned carpets and textiles, capture how Syrians have decorated their surroundings in even the bleakest circumstances.,“I wanted the show not to aestheticize trauma, and despair and ruin,” says Farhat, adding that her aim was “to emphasize how beautiful the works are and . . . how aesthetics are so important to Syrian artists.”,Digital images of the works, including Ammar al-Beik’s short film “The Sun’s Incubator,” are available online on the gallery’s website. But the exhibition — whose title is adapted from a verse by the late Syrian poet Da’ad Haddad — is best viewed in person because of the tactile nature of much of the art and the use of varied materials.,In Kevork Mourad’s dynamic “Sanctuary City,” for example, Gothic-style illustrations of architectural elements on layers of cutout fabric are held together by threads that link the overlapping positive and negative spaces. “Cleansing” by Lara Haddad is printed on a thin fleece blanket of the type handed out by aid organizations at refugee camps, while Oroubah Dieb’s “Displacement I” and “Displacement II” incorporate patterned fabric and stationery, as well as sand, to add texture and vibrant colors to her collaged paintings of families carrying their possessions through the desert.,In marking the 10th anniversary of Syria’s uprising, “In This Moonless Night” powerfully conveys both the huge loss and remarkable resilience of Syria’s people over the past decade, through the lens of some of its most talented artists.,

A new biography presents novel details of his iconoclastic existence.,"Swollen, distorted, painted in bruised mauves and imprisoned in triptychs, the figures in Francis Bacon’s art are among the indelible images of the 20th century. In a new biography, Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan strive to bring into focus the elusive figure of the artist himself.,There already exist pleasurably dishy memoirs of Bacon’s prime by his inner circle. Stevens and Swan, who spent a decade researching “Francis Bacon: Revelations,” aim for a more complete portrait. Bacon himself was tight-lipped about his activities before the exhibition in 1945 of his breakthrough “Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion.” He actively discouraged biographers. But Stevens and Swan are excellent investigators, presenting novel details of Bacon’s early affairs, his short-lived interior-design career and the two years he spent in Hampshire during World War II, when asthma forced his retreat from London.,The book is bejeweled with sensuous detail. We smell the Potter’s Asthma Cure in the wheezing infant Bacon’s bedroom. We glimpse “phosphorescent liquid” sprinkled on Hyde Park to divert German bomber airships away from populated zones during the Great War. We hear “the screams of men being lashed in blood-spattered cells” in the Irish prisons that young Francis trots past.,Such flourishes, which, in true Bacon style, speak “directly on the nervous system,” may well have pleased the artist. “I lived through the revolutionary Irish movement, Sinn Fein, and the wars,” he once explained, “Hiroshima, Hitler, the death camps, and daily violence that I’ve experienced all my life.” Occasionally histrionic descriptions of his life and most famous paintings are thus entirely concordant. “The most disturbing aspect of the carnage is the frenzied brilliance of the killing brush,” Stevens and Swan declare about “Three Studies for a Crucifixion” (1962). “Bacon’s painterly freedom echoes the hysterical letting-go of slaughter and blood lust.” Vivid.,Stevens and Swan suggest that Bacon’s childhood — lonely, sickly, violent, not without psychosexual drama — provided the “physical jolt” that catalyzed his art. It seems as likely that his pleasure in deviance was innate. His interest in crime, violent sex and death, all enthusiastically embraced and manifest in his work, often feel more like natural blossoms than the flowers of trauma.,Which is not to say that his life was without trauma. Parental coldness, childhood isolation, the dangers of gay life in an unsympathetic age: all must have affected Bacon. The openings of two major retrospectives were overshadowed by the deaths of lovers. But because tragic events only seemed to confirm his notions of life, one is left with the impression that he rather enjoyed a spot of devastation.,Stevens and Swan are strong on the Aeschylean patterning of Bacon’s life. The overdose of his muse George Dyer on the eve of his 1971 retrospective in Paris was, they say, a “cruel rhyme” with the death of ex-boyfriend Peter Lacy during his Tate exhibition nine years earlier — albeit with grimmer details. After securing a hotelier’s agreement to keep Dyer’s  bathroom demise quiet till after the opening reception, Bacon spent the evening at the Grand Palais with Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and President Georges Pompidou before a painting that depicted Dyer, with dark irony, “slumped over the loo” — the very tableau he’d grimly burlesqued in death. Bacon’s “art no longer seemed an exaggeration. It was the truth, imperfectly concealed by a party.” He later returned repeatedly to the hotel where George had died — a “private ritual of expiation.”,But while his life had “moments of intense melancholy and despair,” merriment went largely uncurbed.,That merriment took place in Soho, where Bacon reigned as demon king, scarfing oysters and drinking champagne night after night. His relationship with Lucian Freud, close till Freud’s sales took off, is examined in depth, as are friendships with subjects Isabel Rawsthorne, Henrietta Moraes, and Muriel Belcher — welcome reminders that his world wasn’t just a boys’ club. Memorable, too, is Valerie Beston — “Valerie from the Gallery” — who, effectively, managed Bacon for years, perhaps saving many artworks from destruction (he was notoriously brutal with his paintings).,The iconoclastic charm of the artist keeps the pages turning. Breezily, outrageously gay when it was neither fashionable nor legal, here Bacon — whether booing Princess Margaret, declaring his attraction to Libya’s Moammar Gaddafi or bragging that he’d bought the house he’d be murdered in — is truly the nihilist-satyr of legend, “a rush of night air into England’s stuffy room.”,Bacon once said that telling his life story “would take a Proust.” A tall order — though Stevens and Swan do share a Proustian eye for the social whirl and the encroachments of “time and the wrecking ball.”,As an old man, Bacon might even be said to resemble Proust’s sadomasochistic Baron de Charlus, counting off the dead in a society completely transformed in his lifetime. One of the achievements of “Revelations” is to capture this social change alongside the life of its subject. It’s a portrait of vanished worlds, of a 20th-century style of darkness now past. Our fresh horrors await new geniuses.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/31/godzilla-vs-kong-battle/,‘Godzilla vs. Kong’: Which of our big boys has the power to win?,"Part of the beauty of cinema lies in how it allows us to reflect on the most vital questions of our time — namely, if a nuclear-radiated sea monster could pummel a big gorilla, or whether that massive ape might just be the true prehistoric god-king of the earth.,Such weighty questions require careful thought, the sort that inspired the Renaissance greats to carve thinking men out of stone. One might recall these chiseled figures upon watching Alexander Skarsgard emphatically state ,, “This is our only chance. We have to take it. We , Kong. The world needs him.”,But does the world truly need Kong? Does he stand a chance against Godzilla? Before we “let them fight,” as Ken Watanabe , in 2014′s “,,” join us in admiring (and scorning) these two big boys as we make the case for which gargantuan creature should reign supreme. Their epic brawl , in theaters and on HBO Max.,Off the bat, you have to,acknowledge that Godzilla looks cooler and meaner.,But what is he? Or she?,Is it a big lizard? A dinosaur-human hybrid? Well, technically it’s a kaiju,,which translates from Japanese as “strange beast.”,Sure, the atomic-breather,of old was nothing more than , in a rubber body suit. But the lore of what Godzilla stands for,means more than any large gorilla.,The mythical monster was created as a stand-in for the fear and terror of the nuclear weapons that devastated Japanese society. Since appearing in 1954, the creature has inspired tales ranging from 1968′s monster tag-teaming “Destroy All Monsters” to the brilliant 2016 political satire “,,” which brought the threat of,nuclear peril to the modern day with the 2011 ,.,Godzilla’s depictions have spanned the globe for decades, from novels to video games. But let’s get down to the tale of the tape.,In this film canon — which began seven years ago and includes 2017′s “,” and 2019′s “,” — we’ve seen our large lad vanquish its enemy by prying open its mouth and , down its throat and disintegrate two of Ghidorah’s three heads while chewing on the third , before obliterating it for fun. And that’s just for starters.,So for this newest round, in one corner, there is a prehistoric monster that roams the land and sea who can fire off beams of nuclear energy from its mouth and has regenerative powers that allow it to swat away human weaponry like flies. Cloaked in scales, it also has an unmistakable, anguishing roar that lets you know it’s about to go down.,In the other corner, you have a big, chest-thumping gorilla who gets very easily distracted by a pretty lady.,No contest.,If “Tom and Jerry” taught us anything — the cartoon, not that ridiculous new movie with Colin Jost — it’s that size doesn’t count for everything. Speed and agility are underrated players here. If Jerry the mouse can trip Tom by tying his legs together with a string, what’s to stop Kong from doing the same with a vine from stinky Skull Island?,For those who believe size does matter, consider that Kong appears to now be the same height as Godzilla. It’s unclear what led to his practically tripling in size — perhaps it’s that he was an “adolescent” the last time we saw him, , — but facts are facts, and our boy could make a killing hawking monster PediaSure.,To address the obvious: Yes, Godzilla can blast atomic breath. But Kong is showing up to the ring with his very own Mjolnir: an ax that seems able to harness the nuclear fire as Thor’s hammer does lightning (or, at the very least, that can deflect it). We’ve established Kong’s agility, but it must also be said that he has the smarts to strategize. Godzilla, on the other hand, is quite literally operating with a lizard brain.,Not to crib from Jay-Z’s heinous verse on “,,” but an appeal for Kong is also an appeal for love. He simply does not get enough of it. We saw the kindness in his eyes when Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson’s characters encountered him up close in “Skull Island,” and the latest MonsterVerse film embraces that trait. It introduces a story line where Kong essentially joins Rebecca Hall’s anthropological linguist character in bonding with and vowing to protect her adopted daughter, the last surviving member of the indigenous tribe that shared the island with him.,Kong is the more empathetic figure, and that goes a long way in Hollywood. He bows to no one, nor should he."

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/30/john-lewis-run-graphic-novel-release/,"John Lewis’s posthumous new graphic novel will be out this summer, in time for a new battle over voting rights","Preparations for a Southern election are beginning to face fresh obstacles. Polling places are to be moved or removed and, according to at least one American leader, Jim Crow is “alive and well.”,That description is not ,, but rather from a longtime Georgian leader in his forthcoming chronicle of the civil rights movement set in the mid-'60s. If it is true that history doesn’t repeat itself but often rhymes, then the late congressman John Lewis (D-Ga.) will be returning to the national bookshelves this summer as a graphic-novel poet.,Abrams ComicArts and Good Trouble Productions have announced that the Lewis memoir “Run: Book One” — a sequel to the best-selling “March” trilogy — will be published Aug. 3. The civil rights icon completed the story before his death last July at 80, collaborating with “March” co-authors Andrew Aydin and artist Nate Powell, as well as a new member, Texas-based illustrator L. Fury, making her debut as a graphic novelist.,The cover by Powell and Fury reflects the escalation of events after , in Selma and passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act — as some run from or toward racist violence, and some run for office.,“The reason it’s called ‘Run’ is because first you march, then you run,” Aydin said by phone last week. “It’s about showing how a young person like John Lewis can go from being well-known but seen as largely radical by the vast majority of the American republic to being a public servant.”,The “March” books received critical acclaim — including the , for a comic book — while also popularizing and contextualizing a favorite Lewis phrase to urge nonviolent civil disobedience: “Make good trouble.”,“I think the congressman, particularly in the last four or five years, had his eye on how we can inspire and motivate this new generation to participate in the democratic process not just as voters, but as public servants,” said Aydin, who also worked as Lewis’s digital communications director. As he spoke on Friday, the hashtag #GoodTrouble was trending on social media, in response to a sweeping , signed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and lambasted by the White House. Some critics say the law could , Black voters.,The purpose of “Run” is “to show people that the mission did not end with the signing of the Voting Rights Act,” Aydin said. “Turn the page, and the story became a new chapter in the same struggle. Often we celebrate the great victory and forget what happens next.,“When you consider what is happening today,” Aydin continued, it is “urgent that we tell this next chapter.”,“Run: Book One” focuses on the sociopolitical strife in 1965-1966, as Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founding member Julian Bond runs for Georgia office and Lewis hews to his nonviolent philosophy yet loses his SNCC chairmanship to Stokely Carmichael. Meanwhile, the segregationist violence continues, including the Mississippi murder of a wealthy Black businessman by the Ku Klux Klan.,Aydin said the longtime Georgia politician was uplifted by how many young readers embraced his life story in illustrated form: “They gave the congressman this reinvigorating energy — at conventions he got energy from them — and that’s how he knew he was on the right path.”"

But while it’s a conceit, in the hands of Murakami, it’s also the means to inspiring ends, thanks to its memorable voices — including a talking monkey who walks into a spa.,Otto and Xavier embark, with their pet mongoose, on a sleeper train called the Lucky Day. At first, it seems luxurious. But things become surreal quickly, making Oyeyemi’s locomotive the weirdest since “,.”,If you thought Rumaan Alam’s apocalyptic “,” was too creepy, perhaps you shouldn’t read VanderMeer’s new speculative thriller, in which a woman called Jane Smith receives a note and a key from a dead eco-terrorist.

Lynette wants to buy the small house she shares with her mother and developmentally challenged brother, but she doesn’t have quite enough money. Over two days and two nights, she courts danger in her attempt to forge a secure life.,Heiny’s hilarious novel spans two decades in the life of small-town Michiganders. Jane moves to Boyne City in 2002 to teach second grade, and soon her life includes a mandolin-happy best friend, a husband, two daughters and a responsibility she could never have imagined.

Before she embarks on the shifting perspectives that guide “,” through five generations and four countries, Garcia provides the diagrams of two matrilineal family trees.,Like the lyric narratives that follow, these family trees feature the first names of women. Abusive men damaged these trees and deadened their branches, but matriarchs are the root of these stories.,Still, mothers don’t always know what to do. “Of Women and Salt” begins with a plea from a Cuban American woman named Carmen, who begs her daughter Jeanette to find the will to endure despite traumas both inherited and experienced. “Maybe there are forces neither of us examined. Maybe if I had a way of seeing all the past, all the paths, maybe I’d have some answer as to why: Why did our lives turn out this way?”,For that, Garcia reaches back to 1866 in Camagüey, Cuba, where María Isabel becomes the first woman in her cane-cutting line to roll cigars and, soon thereafter, to read. Subjected to harassment, lesser wages and unwanted advances in a shadowy cigar factory, she becomes enraptured by books read aloud to the workers by a lector who quickly falls in love with her.,Their union, forged during a Cuban rebellion against Spanish colonial rule and slavery, ends with blood that births a new future. Liberation is not linear — not for countries nor for women. Though María Isabel “wanted to write her life into existence and endure,” not all freedoms are made possible by resilience.,“Of Women and Salt” leaps forward to 2014 in Miami. María Isabel’s great-great-granddaughter Jeanette is sleepless during a new and tremulous sobriety. Freer than she feels, Jeanette is on probation after being in rehab. Addicted to prescription drugs, she is haunted by stories that have gone untold for too long. Her brittle mother Carmen “lives among the Cuban elite, the First Wave, the people who lost homes and businesses and riches and ran from communism at the start of the revolution.”,Jeanette has never spoken to Carmen’s mother, Dolores, who still lives in rural Cuba. Riven by sexual and substance abuse, domestic violence and political tensions, their family ruptured during traumatic episodes disclosed with the flickering of time in future chapters.,María Isabel and her descendants found strength to endure, but their survival strategies relied upon silence and estrangement. Their matrilineal wisdom, which should have been a birthright for every woman born into that family, instead surfaces intermittently across the centuries. Burdened with longings shared by her ancestors, Jeanette “didn’t have the vocabulary to say,,.”,After witnessing an ICE raid that leads to her neighbor’s deportation, Jeanette gives food and shelter to a small girl named Ana, who arrives home from the babysitter to find a locked and darkened apartment. So begins the interrupted flourishing of the other family tree, planted in unstable soil whether in El Salvador, the United States or Mexico.,Ana is caught in what Valeria Luiselli described as a “hemispheric war” over drugs and arms amidst U.S. complicity in the fractured economies of Central and South America. In “,,” Luiselli writes, “Those children are refugees of a war, and, as such, they should all have the right to asylum. But not all of them have it.”,Ana’s mother, a hard-working housekeeper named Gloria, left El Salvador because of gang violence that reshaped her entire existence. As “Of Women and Salt” unfolds, U.S. immigration officials treat her family as though their lives and contributions have no value.,Fearful that her attempts to provide care might be in violation of her probation, Jeanette cannot be what Ana needs. During a deportation process meted out with “papers they won’t translate,” Gloria prays for outcomes she can’t control. “I do not want my child here, where every child has a cough and the guards run their eyes over curves, hungry. I do not want my child here but I do not want her alone thousands of miles away. I want my child safe.”,The bonds of motherhood are deep and tenuous. Though it “is ugly to admit” her pain and confusion, Gloria defines motherhood as “a constant calculation of what-if. What if we just gave up?” In “Of Women and Salt,” the women do not surrender their hopes, but they also flail against fates they never would have chosen for themselves nor their daughters.,Though “there are no real rules that govern why some are born in turmoil and others never know a single day in which the next seems an ill-considered bet,” the forces that shape these families are unmistakably patriarchal, capitalist and colonial. Against these tides of injustice, mothers and daughters fight to stay afloat, clinging to the wisdom that “we are more than we think we are.”,

It’s an affecting reminder that no matter how comfortable and settled things feel, life is always about change — changing places, changing careers and even changing loyalties.,Sweeney’s comic debut, “,,” was a breakout success in 2016. To hilarious effect, it focuses on four siblings bickering over their late father’s trust fund. “Good Company” is a sweeter novel, gentler all around, though the stakes are higher than the disappointments of a few middle-aged leeches.,Also, “The Nest” is very much a novel about living in New York, while “Good Company” is about having left it behind for Los Angeles. Sweeney made the cross-country transition herself in 2009, so she knows how questioning that decision can remain a haunting compulsion. Her new characters — actors of various kinds who have moved to L.A. — are still judging their commercial productions in La La Land against artistic endeavors in the Big Apple. For most readers, though, “Good Company” will resonate as a story about those rare choices that define life by cleanly dividing it into Before and After.,In the opening pages of “Good Company,” Flora is looking for an old photo that captures a cherished summer back in Upstate New York. Her daughter is about to graduate from high school in Los Angeles, and Flora knows the snapshot, nicely framed, would make a perfect present. But when Flora finds the picture among some old papers in the garage, she also finds the wedding ring that her husband, Julian, claimed he’d lost in a lake that summer. Its reappearance suddenly calls into question what was really going on during those August nights — and during all the years since.,“Good Company” functions very much like that beloved photo. It’s a moment caught in time, but its meaning is informed by everything around it. Flora and Julian and their friends may be smiling and looking at the camera, but that doesn’t mean they were all seeing the same thing. And this novel plays with time in a similarly complex way, moving back into the history of a small group to bring everything to bear on the perfectly staged image of “the couple everyone wanted to be.”,Flora and Julian are the exceptional theater people who seem to have done the impossible: made a stable life together. “Flora didn’t realize how much she’d invested in the mythology of her marriage,” Sweeney writes. “Like good actors, they whittled it down to a few symbolic moments that added up to the legend of Florian.”,There are no villains in “Good Company,” which only makes the theme of betrayal more poignant — and more realistic. As Flora tries to figure out what the rediscovered wedding ring means and what she’s going to do about it, we’re drawn deep into the experiences of her family and her most trusted friends, Margot and David. Over the years, they’ve grown much more successful and considerably wealthier — Margot is a TV star, David is a doctor — but the two families have never let that push them apart. What develops is a story about the twisted strands of devotion and envy that hold any long-term relationship together.,Before she got married, Flora hoped to make her mark on Broadway, and though she got a few small parts now and then, she lived the precarious life of so many part-time artists in New York. But eventually, Flora gave up her dreams, stepped away from “legitimate theater” and started doing voice-over work for commercials. Suddenly, she felt she was hovering in the confluence of her old theater colleagues’ pity and envy.,Sweeney builds that conflict between artistic purity and adult practicality right into Flora’s marriage. While she makes the sacrifices necessary to keep their family financially solvent, her husband is the co-founder of a theater called Good Company, which becomes “the defining law of their existence.” It’s a noble endeavor, to be sure, one of those high-quality, low-profit Manhattan groups with a summer stock offshoot in Upstate New York. Flora would never admit to being irritated by Julian’s success, but there’s something annoying about the way the world conforms to the desires of handsome, charismatic men like her husband. She can’t help but notice that “a group of young company members — all women, of course — fell into formation like a chorus line executing a series of perfect kicks. One became his de facto assistant, another a self-appointed company secretary, a third kept petty annoyances at bay.”,“Did you organize all this?” Flora asks him.,“No, it just kind of happened,” he replies, oblivious to his own power.,Sweeney’s effectiveness as a novelist stems from her protean sympathy, her ability to move among these characters and capture each one’s feelings without judgment. As we see some of the same events from various points of view, we don’t learn who was right — who could ever be right, after all? — but we get a poignant, sometimes comic sense of the way we each experience the same events, the same decisions, the same mistakes. In Sweeney’s hands, that’s not a recipe for endless conflict, but a road to understanding and — maybe — forgiveness.,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/30/tina-turner-documentary/,Tina Turner’s story has long been intertwined with Ike Turner’s. ‘Tina’ lets her have the last word.,"When Tina Turner’s fifth album, “Private Dancer,” shimmied up the Billboard chart in 1984, it was widely hailed as her comeback effort. But the singer disagrees with that assessment.,“I don’t consider it a comeback album. Tina had never arrived,” Turner says in a new HBO documentary about her life and career. “It was Tina’s debut.”,That’s a powerful statement from the musical icon, who famously kept the stage name she was given by her abusive ex-husband, Ike Turner, following their 1978 divorce. “Tina” reminds us that her name was about the only thing Turner wanted to keep from her first marriage; it was the news media that continued to make Ike Turner and his abuse a prominent focus of interviews about the singer and her work.,“Tina,” directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, isn’t as revelatory as other , — its strength lies in context, which the filmmakers provide through archival footage and contemporary interviews with Turner; her second husband, Erwin Bach; journalists and a few friends, including Oprah Winfrey.,Here are the biggest takeaways from the nearly two-hour film.,The documentary recalls Turner’s fateful trip to see Ike Turner’s band play in St. Louis in the late ’50s. She asked that night if she could join him onstage, but Ike refused because “he didn’t believe I could sing,” Turner recalls in audio from a 1981 interview with People magazine. Turner continued to show up to the band’s gigs, and eventually Ike relented. Her voice, full-bodied and husky, blew him away.,At just 17, Turner began singing with the band every weekend. “I was young, naive — just a country girl,” Turner recalls in a contemporary interview. “And everything just opened up to me.”,Initially, as Turner recalled in her People interview, their relationship was based in “a family love.” But when the duo landed their first hit record, “A Fool in Love,” in 1960, Ike rebranded his band as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue — and decided that Tina should be his wife.,“She really was young. She had no ambition to be a superstar,” recalls Jimmy Thomas, who sang background vocals for the revue. “But when she sang, she just had it. And Ike exploited it.”,In her interview with People, Turner noted that Ike — who had gone uncredited on “Rocket 88,” the pioneering rock-and-roll record he recorded with his band in 1951 — had deep-seated insecurities about being left behind by acts that he’d helped to find fame.,Turner was pregnant with her and Ike’s son, Ronnie, when she disagreed with travel arrangements Ike had planned for the band.,He responded by beating her with a shoe stretcher, Turner said in her People interview. His abuse continued until she left him in 1976. “Maybe I was brainwashed. I was afraid of him, and I cared what happened to him. And I knew that if I left, there was no one to sing,” Turner says in the audio.,As Turner’s star rose, Phil Spector, then an influential record producer, asked to work with Turner — and only Turner. Though their first collaboration, the 1966 single, “River Deep — Mountain High,” was considered a commercial flop (in the United States at least), Turner got a taste of freedom working with Spector, who encouraged her to branch out from beyond how she typically performed with Ike. (Though, Ike is credited on the song as part of a deal with Spector.),“It was so big, and my voice sounded so different standing on top of all that music,” Turner says of the song.,At this point, Turner says she no longer loved Ike. But she continued to work with him out of loyalty, and was determined to help him get a hit record. She achieved that with the duo’s Grammy-winning cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” in 1971, though the song only amplified the pressure for success. Ike’s abuse, meanwhile, intensified.,Turner credits her introduction to Buddhism with helping her become confident enough to leave Ike. She reached her limit in 1976 when he struck her on the way to a Dallas airport. The incident informed a memorable scene in the 1993 film “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” which starred Angela Bassett as Turner. In the scene, Tina fights back after Ike strikes her; in real-life, Turner did the same, but after arriving at the hotel bloodied and swollen, she massaged Ike’s head so he would fall asleep.,It was then that Turner made a desperate escape, across a freeway, to a nearby hotel. “I grabbed my little hand luggage and I walked,” Turner recalls in her People interview. “I was afraid, though.”,“Tina” recalls Turner’s packed work schedule following her divorce from Ike, in which she says she “got nothing” except for her name. “That’s when I realized I could use Tina to become a business,” Turner recalls.,The next few years were filled with performances in Las Vegas and on TV specials in a bid to recoup the money she lost in the divorce fallout, which included canceled gigs. Turner eventually recruited Roger Davies to be her manager, leading to higher profile gigs — even as she,encountered vile racism within the music industry — and the new sound that marked a departure from her work with Ike.,Turner’s interview with People music editor Carl Arrington ran in the magazine’s Dec. 7, 1981, issue, and marked the singer’s first public comments on her ex-husband’s abuse. But even after Turner reached the height of her solo career with the Grammy-winning “Private Dancer” (followed by a role in the 1985 film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome”) the singer was constantly asked about Ike and their relationship.,Turner attempted to put those discussions to rest with her 1986 autobiography “I, Tina,” which she co-wrote with Kurt Loder. But the effect was largely the opposite, partially because other women were so inspired by her coming forward.,“That story reached so many people who felt like they had to kind of keep their secrets locked away deep down,” Katori Hall, the , to Broadway, says. “It’s like a Pandora’s box.”,“Tina” is mostly devoted to the singer’s career, but it does briefly discuss her childhood in Nutbush, Tenn., where her family picked cotton and where she witnessed her father’s violence against her mother. Eventually, both of her parents abandoned the family altogether.,“I’m a girl from a cotton field that pulled myself above what was not taught to me,” she says in an archival interview with Loder.,“I have not received love almost ever in my life. I did not have it with my mother and my father from the beginning of birth, and I survived,” she tells him. “Why did I get so far without love … I have had not one love affair that was genuine and sustained itself. Not one.”,Turner tells Loder, pounding her fist on the table for emphasis, that she’s experienced “tons of heartbreak.”,“I’ve analyzed it. I’ve said, ‘What’s wrong with me?’” Turner says. “I’ve looked in the mirror with myself stripped of makeup and without hair. Why can’t someone see the beauty in the woman … I am?”,The documentary’s final act introduces Turner’s husband, Erwin Bach, and their sprawling estate in Zurich. “I really needed love. I just needed to love a person,” Turner says, recalling their first meeting when the former record executive picked her up from Düsseldorf Airport in Germany.,“It’s love. It’s something we both have for each other,” says Bach, whom Turner married in 2013. “I always refer to it as an electrical charge.”,As for her ex-husband, who died in 2007, Turner says she has forgiven him. “Forgiving means not to hold on,” she says. “You let it go.”,“I had an abusive life. There’s no other way to tell the story,” she adds. “It’s a reality. It’s a truth.”,The documentary fittingly ends with footage of Turner attending the premiere of Hall’s musical, where she received a standing ovation. The documentary and the play, Bach says, “is a closure.” As Turner eyes her future away from public life, she reflects on the most graceful way to do it.,“Some people say that the life that I lived and the performances that I gave, the appreciation is lasting with the people and I should be proud of that,” she says. “I am. But when do you stop being proud? How do you bow out slowly?”"

He was 81.,The cause was complications from Parkinson’s disease, said his wife, Lore Willner Dickstein. Dr. Dickstein taught for four decades at the City University of New York, where he founded the Graduate Center’s Center for the Humanities.,Dr. Dickstein was part cultural historian, part literary critic. His emergence followed the postwar heyday of the public intellectual, when such heavyweights as Irving Howe, Irving Kristol and Nathan Glazer battled for ideas in pages of magazines such as Dissent and Commentary and embodied what writer Jonah Raskin , as a “mystique” that extended far beyond the salon and ivory tower.,“We could round up the usual suspects,” Dr. Dickstein remarked, endeavoring to explain the forces that had conspired to push him and his colleagues to the margins — “the turn toward theory, jargon, professionalization; the decline of the centrality of literature among the arts, followed by the decline of book culture itself; the separation of academics from the wider world of general readers; the collapse of literary journalism.”,The Internet was a principal culprit, he added, “offering worldwide distribution but substituting the gripes and hosannas of ordinary readers for the authority of trained and experienced critics.”,A self-described “freethinking intelligence yet a child of the ghetto,” Dr. Dickstein was the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He spent his boyhood on the Lower East Side of New York and eventually studied at Columbia, Yale and the University of Cambridge under the most renowned of those trained and experienced thinkers — among them F.R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling and Harold Bloom.,In his own books and prolific writings, which appeared in newspapers including the New York Times and journals such as Partisan Review, Dr. Dickstein eschewed the hyper-academic style that had driven readers away from literary criticism not because the readers were unintelligent, but because the critics were unintelligible. (Remarking on developments in his profession, he wryly observed that “criticism of criticism now has its own comfortable niche.”),Instead he sought to cultivate a style that was erudite but accessible to readers engaged with the world of culture. Unlike colleagues who wielded their pen like a drill, boring a hole ever deeper into a single rarefied topic of interest (or noninterest), Dr. Dickstein displayed an intellectual virtuosity, exploring the works of writers as varied as the English Romantic poets and the Beat Generation. In typical fashion, he drew an unexpected connection between the two groups.,Dr. Dickstein said he fell in love with Romantic poets such as John Keats for the very reason they had earlier fallen out of favor with T.S. Eliot and critics of his ilk. “The Romantics were seen as loose and undisciplined in their language, their morals, their urgent strength of feeling,” Dr. Dickstein told Raskin, explaining the objections. With such qualities, though, he said the poets prepared him for his study of the 1960s, the subject of one of his best known books.,“,” (1977) was Dr. Dickstein’s first major work, an examination of a decade that, as he wrote, produced “one of those deep-seated shifts of sensibility that alter the whole terrain.”,He probed what he regarded as the enduring brilliance of Norman Mailer’s New Journalism, the poetry of Robert Lowell and the comic novels of , in commentary that he leavened with personal confessions. ,Tom Wolfe’s 1968 book “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” was “stupefyingly boring,” he wrote. “I got through only half of it.”,The result, Times book critic Dwight Garner , in 2009, was “a book warmed by [such] injections of his own experiences during the decade and by his willingness occasionally to shoot from the hip.”,Dr. Dickstein examined his own profession in “,” (1992), then delved into literary history in “,” (2002). He published “,” (2005) before turning to the Depression in the cultural history “,” (2009).,That book, a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award, was a collection of writings on the works of authors such as John Steinbeck, filmmakers such as Frank Capra, composers including George Gershwin and photographers such as Dorothea Lange. “These admirably written pieces,” the critic , wrote in , for the Los Angeles Times, “are marked by a generosity of spirit that never deteriorates into the quarrelsome.”,Morris Dickstein was born in Manhattan on Feb. 23, 1940. He lived on the Lower East Side until he was 9 and then moved to Queens, where his mother and father, who came from Ukraine and Poland, respectively, ran a dry goods store.,His parents sent him to a yeshiva, although he would later resist the restrictions of Orthodox life. In a memoir, “,” (2015), Dr. Dickstein described his personal evolution as an “education of the feelings as well as the mind, a journey from one world to another, from an immigrant Jewish family to a secular, cosmopolitan society, a coming of age in a culture that was itself going through startling transitions that inevitably carried me along.”,He obtained a scholarship to attend Columbia, where he received a bachelor’s degree in English in 1961. He then enrolled at Yale, where he received a master’s degree in English literature in 1963 and, after studies in England at Clare College Cambridge, a doctoral degree in 1967. (The adviser for his thesis, a study of Keats, was Bloom.),Dr. Dickstein taught at Queens College before joining CUNY in 1974. He retired in 2013.,Besides his wife of 56 years, of Manhattan, survivors include two children, Jeremy Dickstein, also of Manhattan, and Rachel Dickstein of Brooklyn; a sister; and four grandchildren.,At its most essential, Dr. Dickstein saw his responsibility, and that of any critic, to reveal the “sea of hype” upon which he found many books, films and other works of art to be bobbing along. “Only when you read a serious review do you see the issues underneath,” he , in 1998. “Criticism plays a very important role in keeping people honest.”,

https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/03/29/lil-nas-satan-blood-shoes/,A prank company and Lil Nas X are selling ‘Satan Shoes’ containing a drop of human blood. Nike is suing.,"Adorned with a pentagram and the number 666, the sneakers would stand out even if you didn’t know what they supposedly contained: a drop of human blood.,The bodily fluid from employees of , mixes with ink to fill an air bubble in each pair of the “Satan Shoes,” a new collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X that has ignited the Internet with a mixture of shock, disgust and amusement.,The kicks are transformations of Nike Air Max 97s and are pegged to the release of Lil Nas X’s new single, , whose video includes the singer sliding down a pole into hell and gyrating on top of the devil while singing seductively ,.,“We always talked about doing the Satan Shoes internally and when Nas told us about his new song we knew it was a match made in heaven (or better yet hell),” Daniel Greenberg, one of MSCHF’s founders, wrote in an email.,Nike on Monday sought to indicate its stance on the kicks in the clearest way possible: It launched a federal lawsuit asking the court to have the sneakers destroyed.,In the complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York, the behemoth athletic wear company referenced social media backlash from people who vowed never to buy Nike products again because of the Satan Shoes. The lawsuit alleges trademark violations by MSCHF and demands that the prank company relinquish to Nike any profits that it made from selling the sneakers.,“This was done without Nike’s approval or authorization, and Nike is in no way connected with this project,” the company wrote.,Representatives of MSCHF did not respond to a message seeking comment on the lawsuit.,The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declined to answer a question about whether the company could face legal repercussions for marketing the sneakers. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission did not respond to questions about the safety of the product containing human blood, which can carry viruses.,Each pair of Satan Shoes is decorated with small inverted crosses and the phrase , a biblical passage that references Jesus seeing “Satan fall like lightning from heaven.” Red numbering on the back of each shoe identifies it as belonging to one of 666 pairs that MSCHF is selling for $1,018 each. Typical Air Max 97s sell for about $100 to $200.,By Monday afternoon, , said all but one pair had been sold and the last would be distributed Thursday by lottery.,The sneakers are a follow-up to , that the company offered for thousands of dollars in 2019, Greenberg said. The firm’s other hits include ,, , and ,.,Unlike some of MSCHF’s other projects, the shoes are more than just a gimmick. The devil theme is a sarcastic play on public criticism that Lil Nas X says he has received for being gay. The 21-year-old rapper, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, has said he wrote “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” ,, who had “promised to die with the secret” of his sexuality.,“People already demonize who I am and put me in a painting of, ‘Okay, he’s evil, he’s doing this, he’s doing that,’ ” Lil Nas X ,. “So it’s like, you know what? I’ll take that. I’ll be that, and I’m going to make the best of it.”,Backlash to the shoes largely centered on the idea that the product promotes evil.,“Our kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it’s ‘exclusive,’ ” , South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R). “But do you know what’s more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul. We are in a fight for the soul of our nation. We need to fight hard. And we need to fight smart. We have to win.”,Televangelist Mark Burns , that the Satan Shoes are “a reason why we Christians must be prayed up ready to battle in the spirit with the Voice of the Holy Spirit. This is evil & heresy and I pray that Christians rise up against this.”,In a nod to the outrage, Lil Nas X published , in which he suggests that he’s about to renounce the shoes before the screen cuts to a shot from the music video of him crowning himself with Satan’s horns. The singer also took a swipe at fast-food restaurant Chick-fil-A, which has donated to organizations that oppose same-sex marriage, with , tailored to the business.,Sneakers, which have been , for decades, have become signifiers of cultural relevance and common collectors’ items. Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, said she expects that some consumers who rushed to buy the Satan Shoes will turn them around for a profit on the resale market, where the media hype will make the sneakers valuable commodities.,But Semmelhack said other customers will inevitably be drawn to the narrative tied up in the shoes. In addition to their shock value, she said the sneakers seem to reflect Lil Nas X’s frustration with his treatment as a gay man.,“I think the message that he’s trying to send is more complicated and deserving of a larger discussion than it being simply a marketing ploy,” Semmelhack said. “He is making a comment about society.”"

And bat she did. It took 12 years of acting for Sharon Stone to hit the big time, but success when it came, with “Basic Instinct,” was huge. Acclaim and award nominations followed for “Casino,” “The Mighty” and “The Muse.” A brain hemorrhage nearly killed her in 2001, but she recovered, then modeled for Dior. She’s raised millions for HIV/AIDS research and worked tirelessly to help homeless people in Los Angeles. She accepted the Peace Summit Award from the Dalai Lama in 2013.,Now 63, Stone has stepped back up to the plate with a candid memoir, “,.” While it contains some startling personal revelations, equally affecting is Stone’s warmth and grace, qualities that, by the end, feel quite miraculous. “I have learned to forgive the unforgivable,” she writes. “My hope is that as I share my journey, you too will learn to do the same.”,Her childhood was outdoorsy: concrete-pouring, barn-painting, treehouses. “I grew up hangin’ with the guys.” Her parents “did a horrible, beautiful, awful, amazing job.” There was laughter, there was violence. Although she had a difficult relationship with her mother, and her father sometimes beat her, she’s nostalgic for the blue-collar Pennsylvania of her youth: “There is still something about the sound of a screen door banging.”,Starting young, she was harassed: by a boy in the playground, her high school science teacher, her manager at McDonald’s. As a teenager, she had an abortion, the consequence, she suggests, of gaps in her sex education.,But, as she reveals here for the first time, there was another kind of trauma in Stone’s childhood, too. This, she writes, is the “brave time where we can and will say this out loud.” She and her sister were subjected to repeated sexual abuse at the hands of their grandfather, incidents that ended only with his death when Stone was in her teens.,The consequences were, naturally, devastating: “We lost a lifetime of love, of our family.” The details she presents, while vivid, are not prurient. And, anticipating the inevitable headlines, they come with a judicious reminder to reviewers and commentators. “Generation after generation,” she writes, “we will still be learning just how to talk about and deal with abuse without being abusive in our very discussions, sensationalistic in our interest, cruel with our concern.”,Like many survivors of abuse, Stone found it difficult to escape its control, even after her grandfather’s death. Only since she’s been able to speak to other survivors — and to her mother, who says she was unaware of what was going on — does Stone feel that she and her family can be “present with one another. The real brutality of that is that it is decades later.”,Coming out the other side: This could be the “living twice” of the book’s title. But living twice is also the liberation that comes from ceasing to chase some “idea that developed centuries ago.” It’s the growing primacy of Stone’s own truth, her increasing impatience with the old patriarchal order. It’s emerging alive from a major neurological event, despite a 1 percent chance of survival. “There is something that happens when you start over, live again,” she writes. “A kind of mystery unraveling.” The mystery, perhaps, of why we ever accepted things the way they were.,A compulsion to unravel — to demystify — drives her eviscerating portrait of Hollywood. “Many people ask me what it was like in my days of being a superstar,” she writes. “It was like this. Play ball or get off the field, girl.” She’s seen it all, from the petty (the line producer on “Basic Instinct” who called her Karen and reminded her that she was the 13th choice for the part) to the downright sick (the director “who wouldn’t direct me because I refused to sit in his lap to take direction”). Amazingly, it’s “the ones who have threatened to fire me if I didn’t put out” who are “the less violent trespassers of my personal space.”,But Stone doesn’t name names. “We are ready to sing a new story,” she writes, “and this now is how I am going to sing it.” Positive action; a road map. There are resources and guidance for survivors of sexual and domestic abuse. Writing with zeal and urgency, Stone argues for a stronger legal system, for rape kits on police shelves to be processed, for better training for teachers and pediatricians. Above all, she offers a hopeful glimpse of life beyond trauma. “Today, my mother and I are at the beginning of our relationship,” she says. “If I hadn’t finally stopped keeping this horrible secret, I would never have known her.”,“The Beauty of Living Twice” promises the possibility of improvement or redemption, of compassion and understanding, of living honestly. Stone dedicates the book to her mother, herself a survivor of childhood abuse, and suggests she might yet, in her 80s, be “the torch that carries the light for women of her generation who are no longer afraid to stand up and be counted.” It’s a hopeful, urgent message.,
